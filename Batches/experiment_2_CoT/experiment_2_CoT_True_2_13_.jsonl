When did he hand over his letter dated 31 October 2005 for dispatch? When was it registered by the staff of the detention facility? Did the delay in dispatching the above letter to the Court amount to hindrance of the applicant\u2019s right of application, in breach of Article 34 of the Convention (see for comparison Sevastyanov v.

Was the investigation in the present case by the domestic authorities in breach of Article 3 of the Convention? In particular:- Did the absence of instituted criminal proceedings prevent investigative measures, which could correspond to the notion of an effective investigation, as required by the Court\u2019s case-law under Article 3 of the Convention (see, mutatis mutandis, Taraburca v.

Which of the investigation methods employed for a preliminary investigation under Articles 150-226 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP) could be and were employed, in the present case, in the course of the inquiry under Article 144 of the Code?- Were persons from whom explanations (\u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0441\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f) were taken liable for false statements or a refusal to testify?(b) The respondent Government are requested to submit a copy of the refusal to prosecute dated 30 January 2003 and other related refusals to institute criminal proceedings.3.

Was there a violation of that Article on account of the alleged delay in compiling the arrest record and the unavailability of legal assistance during the relevant period of time? Were the alleged shortcomings in breach of Russian law and/or \u201cgross and obvious irregularities\u201d (see for comparison Boris Popov v. Russia, no. 23284/04, \u00a7\u00a7 70-77, 28 October 2010)?(b) The respondent Government are requested to submit a copy of the arrest record (\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u043e\u043a\u043e\u043b \u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f) of 25 December 2002, as well as extracts from the relevant logbooks concerning the applicant\u2019s presence at and his departure from the police station, the Organised Crime Unit and the detention facilities on 25-27 December 2002.4. Did the applicant have a fair hearing in the determination of the criminal charges against him, in accordance with Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention? In particular:(a) Was there a breach of this provision on account of the alleged violation of the privilege against self-incrimination and the right to remain silent in relation to the applicant\u2019s self- incriminating statements, which were made, allegedly, under duress and without legal assistance? When was the applicant first informed of his right not to incriminate himself (in relation to victims Ko., Kol. or another case)? Was it before or after he made self\u2011incriminating statements concerning Mr Ko.\u2019s and Mr Kol.s cases? What was the exact scope of this right under Russian law? What was the exact wording by which such information was conveyed to the applicant? Was such information conveyed in a manner which allowed him to understand the scope of this right and the significance of waiving it? Was any such waiver recorded in the presence of a lawyer or after the applicant had access to legal advice on the question whether or not he should waive his right?(b) Was there a violation of Article 6 \u00a7\u00a7 1 and 3 of the Convention on account of the alleged violations of the applicant\u2019s right to legal assistance after the applicant\u2019s arrest in December 2002? In particular:- What was the applicant\u2019s status in the pending criminal proceedings concerning Mr Ko. and Mr Kol. before 25 December 2002? Was there any suspicion against the applicant before that date? In other words, was he sufficiently \u201caffected\u201d by the pending criminal proceedings to engage Article 6 before and on 25 December 2002 (see Aleksandr Zaichenko v. Russia, no. 39660/02, \u00a7\u00a7 42 and 43, 18 February 2010)?- When was the applicant first informed of his right to legal assistance? Was it before or after he made self-incriminating statements concerning Mr Ko.\u2019s and Mr Kol.s cases? What was the exact scope of this right at the relevant stage of proceedings? What was the exact wording by which such information was conveyed to the applicant? Noting the cross-references between Articles 46, 49, 91, 92 and 100 of the CCrP in the relevant parts, was such information conveyed in a manner which allowed him to understand the scope of this right, including free legal assistance, and the significance of dispensing with the services of a lawyer?- Did the applicant waive this right once or several times in December 2002? Was any such waiver recorded in writing and in the presence of a lawyer or after the applicant had access to legal advice on the question whether or not he should waive his right?- When did the applicant first talk to his counsel? Did he talk to counsel before the investigative measures, for instance an interview (\u0434\u043e\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441)? Was counsel present during the investigative measures?- Did the absence or delay of legal assistance in December 2002 entail \u201cirretrievable\u201d damage to the defence, thus leading to a violation of Article 6 of the Convention (see Salduz v. Turkey [GC], no. 36391/02, \u00a7 55, ECHR 2008, and Mehmet \u015eerif \u00d6ner v. Turkey, no. 50356/08, \u00a7\u00a7 21-23, 13 September 2011)?(c) In addition, was there a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention on account of the use made of any tainted evidence at the applicant\u2019s trial (see for comparison Pavlenko v. Russia, no. 42371/02, \u00a7\u00a7 114-120, 1 April 2010)? Was any evidence obtained during the relevant period of time (confessions, etc.) used for convicting the applicant? Was the applicant\u2019s conviction based, solely or to a decisive extent, on such evidence? Were any alleged deficiencies arising of the pre-trial problem relating to legal assistance and duress remedied at the trial and on appeal against the judgment of 9 June 2006?.\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}
