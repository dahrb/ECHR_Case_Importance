The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Mr Mihai Basturea, is a Romanian national, who was born in 1967 and is currently detained in Poarta Alb\u0103 Prison. He is represented before the Court by Ms L. Diaconu, a lawyer practising in Constan\u021ba.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.By a final judgment of 26 February 2015 the Constan\u021ba Court of Appeal convicted the applicant for intentional refusal to pay his taxes and sentenced him to a year and four months imprisonment.On 3 March 2015 the applicant was detained in Poarta Alb\u0103 Prison.On an unspecified date, because of a pre-existent medical condition, the applicant suffered after his incarceration a right sided Sylvian ischemic cerebral vascular accident with paralysis.The applicant was hospitalised for two days in a civilian hospital. Subsequently, even though he was no longer able to walk, talk, sit up, dress, clean himself up, or go to the bathroom on his own, he was transferred to Poarta Alb\u0103 Prison Hospital.In the aforementioned prison hospital, the applicant had to share a 4 square meters cell with four other inmates and was left to manage on his own or with the help of his fellow inmates. He was not prescribed or given any treatment for the recovery of his moving or talking abilities. He suffered several other vascular accidents and became dependent on a wheelchair and his cellmates.According to the medical documents submitted by the applicant before the Court, he needed an assistant.The applicant\u2019s conditions of detention were appalling. The prison system was not fitted with special facilities for disabled persons to move around or to receive visits. There were no special beds or bathrooms fitted with adequate facilities for a disabled person. Also, there were no ramps or adequate facilities for moving around in a wheelchair, which made the applicant\u2019s situation even more serious given that he had only one usable arm and he was almost unable to move. Also he did not have access to any adequate facilities that would help him spend his free time, recover or integrate within the prison\u2019s community.B. Relevant domestic lawExcerpts from the relevant legal provisions concerning the rights of detainees, namely Laws no. 254/2013 as well as the reports of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture, are given in the cases of Iacov Stanciu v. Romania (no. 35972/05, \u00a7\u00a7 116-29, 24 July 2012), and Verde\u015f v. Romania (no. 6215/14, \u00a7 36, 24 November 2015).COMPLAINTSRelying on Article 3 of the Convention the applicant complains that he was subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment on account of the conditions of detention in Poarta Alb\u0103 Prison and Prison Hospital. In particular, he complains of overcrowding, poor hygiene conditions, lack of access to running water and clean bed mattresses, presence of parasites, the absence of any adequate conditions for moving, living and recovery for a disabled person who is unable to manage his own needs unassisted..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicants, Mr Mykola Demyanovych Khadzhyradov (\u201cthe first applicant\u201d) and Ms Vira Petrivna Khadzhyradova (\u201cthe second applicant\u201d), are the father and mother of the late Mr Demyan Mykolayovych Khadzhyradov, who was born in 1975 and died in 2007. Both applicants live in Tashchenak.A. Issues relating to the health of the applicants\u2019 son in detention and applications for his release on health groundsIn May 2005 Demyan Khadzhyradov arrived at the hospital in Sofiyivska Correctional Colony No. 55 (\u201cthe prison\u201d) to serve his sentence. According to the applicants, when their son arrived at the prison he was suffering from HIV and disseminated tuberculosis.On 8 November 2005 the prison\u2019s medical panel diagnosed the applicants\u2019 son with HIV (clinical stage 4) but did not agree to release him on medical grounds.On 14 February 2006 the diagnosis was confirmed by the regional centre for the prevention and fight against Aids (\u201cthe Aids Centre\u201d).From September 2006, fearing for the life of their son, the applicants requested the prison administration to release him on health grounds.On 3 October 2006 the Aids Centre confirmed that the applicants\u2019 son had HIV at clinical stage 4.According to the applicants, the prison administration, for no valid reason, questioned the conclusions of the Aids Centre and ordered their son to undergo additional tests.On 12 February 2007 the Aids Centre again informed the prison administration that Demyan Khadzhyradov was HIV-positive at clinical stage 4.In March 2007 the prison\u2019s medical panel confirmed the diagnosis and stated that it supported the release of the applicants\u2019 son on health grounds.On 16 March 2007 the prison authorities prepared a court application for the release of Demyan Khadzhyradov on health grounds. A hearing was scheduled for 24 March 2007 but did not take place as the relevant documents had been withdrawn by the head of the prison.On 13 April 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer met their son in prison. He could not walk on his own and was taken to the meeting assisted by prison staff.On 27 April 2007 the prison administration submitted another application to the competent court for the release of Demyan Khadzhyradov on health grounds. A hearing was scheduled for 8 May 2007.On 7 May 2007 Demyan Khadzhyradov died in prison from acute heart failure.B. Medical treatment of the applicants\u2019 son in prisonAccording to the applicants, nothing was done by the prison doctors to improve their son\u2019s condition, despite a drastic deterioration in his health after his arrival in prison. The doctors never consulted civilian medical specialists outside the prison about their son and never attempted to transfer him to such establishments.Referring to Demyan Khadzhyradov\u2019s post-mortem examination, the applicants stated that their son had suffered from fibro-cavitary tuberculosis, which required different treatment than disseminated tuberculosis, for which he had been treated in prison. They also stated that they themselves had had to buy the necessary medication for their son.Lastly, the applicants stated that their son had not been provided with prompt and adequate medical assistance on the last day of his life as he could have been taken to a hospital which had all the necessary resuscitation and intensive care equipment and which was only 300 metres away from the prison.C. Proceedings in connection with the death of the applicants\u2019 sonIn July 2007 the second applicant instituted civil proceedings against the prison in the Vilniansky District Court of Zaporizhzhia Region (\u201cthe District Court\u201d), seeking compensation for the death of her son. On an unspecified date she withdrew the proceedings.It is apparent from the case file that at some stage the applicants lodged a criminal complaint against the prison administration with the District Court, which forwarded it to the prosecutor\u2019s office for investigation.On 9 October 2007 the prosecutor\u2019s office refused to initiate criminal proceedings against the prison administration, finding that Demyan Khadzhyradov had died from a serious illness and that therefore no crime had taken place. The applicants did not appeal against that decision.On 10 October 2007 the first applicant instituted civil proceedings in the District Court against the prison, seeking compensation for his son\u2019s death. He claimed that the death had been caused by a deliberate delay in the release process by the head of the prison and by the prison\u2019s failure to provide his son with appropriate medical care while in detention.On 18 June 2008 the District Court dismissed the first applicant\u2019s claim, finding that he had failed to prove a causal link between the acts or omissions of the prison authorities and the death of Demyan Khadzhyradov.On 12 August and 3 December 2008 the Court of Appeal of Zaporizhzhia Region and the Supreme Court of Ukraine respectively upheld the District Court\u2019s decision.COMPLAINTThe applicants blame the authorities for the death of their son, relying on Article 2 of the Convention..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment.

In doing so, they relied, in part, on the fact that criminal proceedings were pending against an official of the municipal company who had participated in the demolition, for dereliction of duty, and that it would be appropriate for the applicant to seek compensation within the framework of those proceedings.However, by the time the High Administrative Court delivered, on 22 January 2014, its final decision rejecting the applicant\u2019s claim for damages, those criminal proceedings against the official had been discontinued without charges..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment.

He is represented before the Court by Mr A. Postica, Mr P. Postica, Ms N. Hriplivii, Ms L. Potang, lawyers practising in Chi\u015fin\u0103u, and members of the \u201cPromo Lex\u201d association.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.On 6 and 7 April 2009 a protest against alleged electoral fraud took place in the centre of Chi\u015fin\u0103u. The protest was peaceful in the beginning; however, in the afternoon of 7 April 2009 some of the protesters became violent. Clashes with the police took place and the Parliament building and the Presidential Palace were damaged by stone throwing. A large number of police officers and protesters were injured. At a certain moment the police forces, largely outnumbered by the protesters, abandoned the two buildings, allowing several hundred persons to enter. Those persons destroyed and pillaged the buildings, setting parts of the Parliament alight. On the same night some 200 persons were arrested on charges of large-scale disorder. The opposition was accused of an attempted coup d\u2019\u00e9tat.In the night of 7 to 8 April 2009, after having participated at the demonstration of protest, the applicant was returning home together with a group of young persons with a mini bus. At approximately 1 a.m. a group of police officers stopped the mini bus and ordered the driver to follow them to a police station. At the police station the applicant was subjected to severe ill-treatment throughout the whole night by being beaten with batons and with plastic bottles full of water and punched and kicked all over his body. He was also forced to strip naked and do sit-ups.On 10 April at approximately 4 p.m. the applicant was released from detention.On the same day the applicant filed a criminal complaint against the police officers who had ill-treated him. On 13 April 2009 he underwent a forensic medical examination as a result of which numerous bruises were found on his thighs. Later the applicant started to experience headaches and nausea and on 22 April 2009 he was hospitalised with the diagnosis of head concussion. He was released from hospital on 4 May 2009.On 18 May 2010 the Prosecutor\u2019s Office ordered the stay of the investigation on the ground that the persons who had allegedly ill-treated the applicant could not be identified. The applicant challenged the order arguing, inter alia, that the investigation was incomplete.On 10 November 2011 the applicant\u2019s appeal was dismissed by the Rascani District Court.COMPLAINTS1. The applicant complains under Article 3 of the Convention about the ill-treatment received at the hands of the police, the inhuman and degrading conditions of his detention, lack of medical assistance during detention, failure to provide him with food for one day and failure to conduct an effective investigation into his allegation of ill-treatment.2. The applicant also complains under Article 13 of the Convention that he had no effective remedy against the alleged ill-treatment to which he had been subjected..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification.

He is represented before the Court by Mr D. G\u00fcr, a lawyer practising in Istanbul.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.On 8 May 2006 while he was driving in the company of another person, the applicant\u2019s car was stopped and inspected by the police. One pistol, one magazine and seven 7,65 mm calibre cartridges were found in the trunk of the car.On 7 June 2006 the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y public prosecutor\u2019s office filed an indictment with the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Criminal Court of First Instance, charging the applicant with possessing an unregistered firearm, contrary to Section 13 \u00a7 1 of the Fire Arms Act (Law no. 6136) and requesting his punishment.On 5 October 2006 the trial court held the first hearing during which the applicant gave evidence in person and admitted that the materials found in his car belonged to him. At the same hearing the trial court found the applicant guilty as charged and sentenced him to one year\u2019s imprisonment and a fine of 450 Turkish liras (TRY). Having regard to the personality and background of the accused and the manner in which the offence had been committed, the trial court commuted the prison sentence to a fine of TRY 7,300 pursuant to Article 50 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Criminal Code. It also ordered the seizure of the materials found in his car.The Kad\u0131k\u00f6y public prosecutor\u2019s office issued a payment order dated 9 November 2006 and sent it to the applicant. According to the notification service (tebli\u011f mazbatas\u0131), the applicant received the payment order on 27 November 2006. Both before the domestic authorities and the Court, the applicant strongly objected to that finding, claiming that the payment order had never been served on him, while at the same time contesting the veracity of the signature on the notification service.According to the legislation in force at the material time, in the event of failure to pay a fine ordered under Article 50 \u00a7 1 (a) of the Criminal Code in whole or in part, an accused would have to serve a prison term.On 10 January 2007 the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Criminal Court of First Instance, following an examination based on the case file and without holding a hearing, decided to convert the fine imposed into one year\u2019s imprisonment after having observed that the applicant had failed to pay the fine within the statutory thirty day limit. According to the information in the Court\u2019s possession, that court did not summon the applicant or notify him of the procedure before it.On the same day, the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y public prosecutor\u2019s office decided to authorise the applicant\u2019s detention in absentia as the applicant had failed to pay the fine within the specified time-limit as required by the payment order.On 9 February 2007 at approximately 4.15 a.m. the applicant was arrested in Istanbul while driving his car in the vicinity of Kartal neighborhood and subsequently detained and sent to \u00dcmraniye E-type prison. As the applicant had become aware of the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Criminal Court of First Instance\u2019s judgment dated 10 January 2007 on his arrest, his lawyer lodged an application to the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y public prosecutor\u2019s office on the same day with a view to paying the fine.Also on the same day the applicant\u2019s lawyer filed an objection against the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Criminal Court of First Instance\u2019s judgment dated 10 January 2007 pursuant to Article 267 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The lawyer submitted, inter alia, that the aforesaid judgment had not been served on the applicant and that he had effectively been deprived of his right to file an objection against that judgment on time.On 15 January 2007 the applicant\u2019s lawyer submitted another petition in which he reiterated his previous claims, asked for the applicant\u2019s release and requesting a stay of execution of his sentence.On 13 June 2006 the Kad\u0131k\u00f6y Assize Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s objections, holding that the payment order had been served on the applicant on 27 November 2006 and that the signature on the notification service belonged to the applicant.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Mr Jerome Colloredo-Mansfeld, is a Czech national, who was born in 1949 and lives in Zbiroh, Czech Republic. He is represented before the Court by Mr L. Kasl, a lawyer practising in Prague.A. The circumstances of the casesThe facts of the cases, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.The two applications arise from the same restitution proceedings instituted by the applicant\u2019s predecessor, Mr J., and Ms K. in 1992. After Mr J. died in 1998 the applicant joined the proceedings as successor to Mr J.The following summary of facts concerns only the part of the restitution proceedings which is relevant to the applicant. The claims of Ms K., even though decided in the same proceedings, were more extensive and had a different basis.The applicant\u2019s restitution claim concerned movable property, which had been in Opo\u010dno castle. The castle itself belonged to another person of whom the applicant is not an heir. The movable property was initially confiscated from the applicant\u2019s predecessor during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1942 by the order of the German Secret State Police considering him an enemy to the German Reich. After the end of the Second World War the property was once again confiscated in 1945; this time by the Czechoslovak State under the Bene\u0161 decrees as he was considered to be of German nationality. That expropriation was quashed on appeal by the National Council in Prague (zemsk\u00fd n\u00e1rodn\u00ed v\u00fdbor) on 21 January 1947 after it had been established that the applicant\u2019s predecessor was of Czechoslovak nationality and had been loyal to the Czechoslovak State. What happened to the property afterwards is disputed and was discussed in the domestic decisions (see below).Due to the large number of items claimed the first-instance court decided on the claim by way of three partial judgments. First, in 1999 the Pardubice District Court returned to the applicant and Ms. K a collection of paintings. That judgment was upheld on appeal and the defendant\u2019s appeal on points of law was dismissed. These proceedings are not part of the present applications. The second and third judgments gave rise to the present applications.1. Application no. 15275/11On 27 October 2006 the Pardubice District Court ordered the National Heritage Institute to return to the applicant and Ms. K movable property in Opo\u010dno castle. It found that the applicant\u2019s predecessor was the owner of the property on the critical date, that is 25 February 1948, as the earlier confiscation orders had been quashed. Consequently, when the Communist regime prevented him from using the property without any legal ground, the conditions for restitution laid down by the restitution legislation, including loss of ownership after 25 February 1948, had been fulfilled.On 18 October 2007 the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Regional Court quashed the judgment and dismissed the action. It held that the property in question had been taken away from the applicant\u2019s predecessor before 25 February 1948 and therefore the restitution legislation did not apply. Even though it was true that the 1945 confiscation order had been quashed in 1947 the State had used the property without a legal basis before 25 February 1948. It based this decision on two pieces of evidence. First, the court referred to a letter of 24 June 1947 of the national administrator of Opo\u010dno castle to his superiors informing them that the applicant\u2019s predecessor had visited the castle the previous day but had been informed that visits were not allowed. He had thus only deposited some documents in the family archives and left. Second, the Court noted that it knew through the exercise of its functions of a decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of 30 April 1947 by which Opo\u010dno castle with the movable property had been declared State cultural property. That decision was not adduced as evidence in the proceedings.The applicant lodged an appeal on points of law arguing, inter alia, that the appellate judgment had come as a complete surprise and that he had not been requested to supplement his statement of facts as required by the Code on Civil Procedure when the court had the intention to make a different factual assessment from the previous stages of the proceedings. He also maintained that the judgment was based on two pieces of evidence, one of which, the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of 30 April 1947, he had not seen and had not been able to comment upon. He further noted that the second piece of evidence, a letter written on 24 June 1947, actually proved that the applicant\u2019s predecessor had been allowed to dispose of his property. He had entered the castle where he spent seven hours and even deposited some new documents in the family archives.On 11 February 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant. It stated that, unlike in the proceedings concerning the first part of the claim, this time the appellate court had reached its conclusion on the basis of the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of 30 April 1947. It did not comment anyhow on the applicant\u2019s argument that he had not seen that decision.The applicant lodged a constitutional appeal claiming violations of his right to a fair trial.On 11 August 2010 the Constitutional Court dismissed the appeal as manifestly ill-founded. It held that the ordinary courts had comprehensively reasoned that the property had been taken from the applicant\u2019s predecessor before the critical date. In view of the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of 30 April 1947 their conclusions appeared justified. Regarding the complaint that that decision had not been adduced before the courts it noted that under Article 121 of the Code of Civil Procedure it was not necessary to prove facts which were generally known, or known to a court through the exercise of its functions.2. Application no. 15275/11On 22 April 2009 the District Court dismissed the rest of the applicant\u2019s restitution claim. In its reasoning it simply referred to the judgment of the Regional Court of 18 October 2007 and that of the Supreme Court of 11 February 2009.On 27 January 2011 a different chamber of the Regional Court than in the decision of 18 October 2007 upheld the first-instance judgment. It based its decision primarily on the fact that there had been already a final, albeit partial, judgment in the matter which had been upheld by both the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court. It could thus depart from their opinions only if the facts or legal situation were different. The chamber stated that it did not know of the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of 30 April 1947 through the exercise of its functions and therefore it had tried to find the document. Nevertheless it was not able to do so as in the file where it should have been there was only a document from 1957, which, in turn, contained information about the 1947 decision. Nevertheless, it considered that this fact alone cannot lead to a different conclusion than that reached previously, that is that the State had acquired the property before 25 February 1948, as this document had only supplemented other evidence.On 28 November 2011 the Supreme Court dismissed the appeal on points of law lodged by the applicant, holding that the courts in the present case were bound by the decisions of the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court in the same matter and noted that in its previous decision of 11 February 2009 it had found correct the conclusion that the State had acquired the property in question already before 25 February 1948. It held that nothing had been discovered since then that would refute those conclusions. Since the appeal on points of law was inadmissible it could not review the complaint that the decisions had not been based on the evidence taken given that the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture of 30 April 1947 had not been found.On 19 April 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional appeal lodged by the applicant claiming violations of his rights to fair trial and to property as manifestly ill-founded. It acknowledged that the fact that in the same matter the courts had first upheld the applicant\u2019s claim concerning the collection of paintings but then had dismissed the remainder constituted a manifest error. Yet, that alone did not make the decisions which were being challenged unconstitutional. It noted also that it had not issued any decision in the proceedings concerning the collection of paintings and it had always upheld the conclusions that the property had been taken from the applicant\u2019s predecessor before 25 February 1948.B. Relevant domestic law and practiceThe relevant domestic law and practice concerning restitution of property are set out in the Court\u2019s decision in the case of Gratzinger and Gratzingerova v. the Czech Republic (dec.), no. 39794/98, \u00a7 19-44, ECHR 2002\u2011VII.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention that the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture on which the domestic courts based their judgments has not been adduced as evidence and he could not comment on it and that neither the Supreme Court nor the Constitutional Court took appropriate measures to remedy that defect. He also complains that the domestic decisions are insufficiently reasoned.Further, relying on Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 he complains that the domestic courts did not return him the property to which he had a right under the restitution laws..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

She is the mother of the second and third applicants (born respectively in 2010 and 2012).Divorce and custody proceedingsThe first applicant and P.P. married in 2009 in the United States of America and thereafter lived together in Bulgaria.In 2012 P.P. brought judicial proceedings for divorce seeking custody over the children. On 1 March 2013 the Sofia District Court allowed the claim for divorce, but granted custody to the first applicant and held that the children were to live with her at a concrete address in Sofia. The court also determined contact between P.P. and the two children and held that P.P. was to keep the common family dwelling and to pay alimony to the second and third applicants.Both parties appealed. In a decision of 19 February 2015 the Sofia City Court approved a settlement reached in the meantime by the parties as regards custody and contact rights. According to the settlement, the first applicant was to keep custody of the children and P.P. was to have contact rights with the second and third applicants. Thereafter, on 14 April 2015 the Sofia City Court upheld the judgment of the Sofia District Court of 1 March 2013 in the part concerning the family dwelling and alimony. It further held that the two children were to live with the first applicant at an address in Sofia, Bulgaria.According to the first applicant, P.P. complied with the contact regime between 2013 and October 2015, when he retained both children and thereafter refused to allow her to take the children back.Proceedings for a change of custodyOn 3 September 2015 P.P. brought proceedings before the Sofia District Court, asking the court to grant custody in respect of the second and third applicants to him and to deprive the first applicant of parental rights. Shortly thereafter, P.P. collected the children from the first applicant\u2019s address in Varna, where she had started living, and did not return them. The first applicant\u2019s related complaint to the prosecution resulted in the opening of an investigation into her complaint. No information about the outcome of these proceedings has been provided.On an unspecified date, P.P. asked the Kostinbrod District Court to suspend the implementation of the Sofia City Court judgment of 14 April 2015, as an interim measure aimed at securing a future claim for a change of custody which he intended to bring. On 19 May 2016 the Kostinbrod District Court suspended the enforcement of the divorce proceedings\u2019 judgment, which suspension was later quashed as inadmissible by the Sofia Regional Court. On 20 June 2016 P.P. brought a claim for a change of custody (case no. 372/2016), asking the Kostinbrod District Court to award custody of the children to him.On 22 December 2016 P.P. again asked the Kostinbrod District Court to suspend the enforcement of the final judgment of 14 April 2015 or, alternatively, to give temporary custody to him as an interim measure. On 6 February 2017 the Kostinbrod District Court granted P.P.\u2019s request for interim measures and awarded temporary custody to him and contact rights to the first applicant; the court also held that the children were to live with P.P. In a judgment of 3 November 2017 (in case no. 372/2016), the Kostinbrod District Court allowed P.P.\u2019s claim and awarded custody to him and contact rights to the first applicant.Upon an appeal by the first applicant, on 22 June 2018 the Sofia Regional Court quashed in its entirety the decision of 3 November 2017 of the Kostinbrod District Court. The court held that there were no changes in the circumstances which could justify a change in the custody of the children and rejected P.P.\u2019s related claim.On 25 June 2018 the first applicant sought, as an interim measure, custody over the children, pending the end of the proceedings for a change of custody brought by P.P. On 4 October 2018 the Sofia Regional Court granted her request for interim measures and awarded temporary custody to her and contact rights to P.P.On 5 March 2019 the Supreme Court of Cassation did not allow P.P.\u2019s application for cassation review and so the judgment of the Sofia Regional Court of 22 June 2018 (case no. 372/2016) entered into force.Proceedings seeking judicial authorisation for the children\u2019s leaving the countryIn the meantime, in March 2014 the first applicant brought a claim under Article 127a of the Family Code, seeking the court\u2019s authorisation for the children to leave the country with her, in the absence of the father\u2019s agreement. She submitted that both she and the children were Brazilian citizens and they wished to visit their relatives in Brazil.On 28 December 2015 the Sofia District Court allowed the claim for the children\u2019s restricted travel abroad, accompanied only by their mother for the period of two months per year.Upon an appeal by P.P., on 3 July 2018 the Sofia City Court granted permission for the children to travel abroad to Brazil with their mother only. The permission was valid for the following two years and for travel of up to one month per year.The applicant complained before the Inspectorate of the Supreme Judicial Council (\u201cthe Inspectorate\u201d) of the excessive length of the above proceedings. On 11 March 2019 the Inspectorate replied to her that these proceedings had lasted for four years, three months and twenty six days and that their overall duration was not excessive.According to the first applicant, P.P. has kept the identity documents of the second and third applicants. The first applicant is likewise unable to apply for passports for them as the children\u2019s presence is required in that procedure, and P.P. has not allowed it.Domestic violence proceedings against the first applicantOn an unspecified date P.P. brought court proceedings, alleging that the first applicant had been violent on two occasions in December 2017 towards the children and his own mother. His claim for protection against domestic violence was granted at first instance on 1 March 2018. However, the Sofia Regional Court, acting at second instance, quashed the lower court\u2019s judgment in a final decision of 1 June 2018. The Sofia Regional Court found that no act of domestic violence had been committed by the first applicant, who had in fact been the victim of such violence herself on the contested occasions.Enforcement proceedingsThe first applicant obtained a writ of enforcement on 8 July 2015 and sought the bailiff\u2019s assistance with the implementation of the settlement on custody approved by the Sofia City Court on 19 February 2015. Different bailiffs attempted to summon P.P. to voluntarily hand the children over to the first applicant respectively in late 2015, in March 2016 and in September 2017, without success, as P.P. did not live at the address he had provided to the authorities and the children were not enrolled in kindergarten there. In November 2017 the first applicant renewed her requests to the bailiff to proceed with the enforcement. Thereafter, three bailiffs successively withdrew from the case between 21 December 2017 and 21 September 2018, following which the first applicant sought the assistance of a new bailiff.Another writ of enforcement was issued to the first applicant on 10 March 2017 in respect of the contact rights she was granted by the Kostinbrod District Court on 6 February 2017 as an interim measure in the proceedings for a change of custody brought by P.P.On 29 May 2017 the social services issued a mandatory instruction addressed to P.P., directing him to refrain from obstructing contact between the applicants. Upon an appeal by P.P., on 11 May 2018 the Sofia Court of Appeal quashed the instruction. The first applicant appealed and the proceedings are currently pending.Following the issuing of another similar instruction by the social services, P.P. unsuccessfully challenged it before the Sofia Administrative Court which rejected his appeal on 23 July 2018. After a cassation appeal by P.P., on 18 December 2018 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment.The first applicant claims that, despite the efforts of bailiffs and social services alike, she was able to see her children only rarely since October 2015.Relevant domestic lawThe relevant provisions of Bulgarian law in relation to enforcement of judgments on custody rights and criminal sanctions for failure to ensure contact with a child have been set out in the Court\u2019s judgment in the case of Aneva and Others v. Bulgaria, nos. 66997/13 and 2 others, \u00a7\u00a7 83-87, 6 April 2017.According to Article 234 of the Code of Civil Procedure 2007, the court approves agreements between the parties when those are not contrary to the law and good morals. The approval represents a final judicial decision which is not subject to appeal before a higher court. When the agreement concerns only part of the dispute between the parties, the court proceeds to examine the other part falling outside the agreement.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Article 8 of the Convention about the authorities\u2019 failure to reunite them, despite a final court decision approving an agreement giving custody in respect of the second and third applicants to the first applicant. The applicants further complain about their inability to enjoy family life together as a result of the impossibility to leave the country to visit their relatives in Brazil for over four years, as a result of the duration of the separate judicial proceedings concerning the possibility for the children to travel abroad with their mother..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O.

Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

Following a remittal, on 14 October 2011 the Prilep Court of First Instance partially allowed the claim. Although initially undetermined, the plaintiff later set the value of the dispute at MKD 1,000,000 (around EUR 16,200).On 25 November 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal, in which he referred to the dispute value as MKD 204,600.Bitola Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, holding that the value of the dispute was MKD 1,000,000.On an unspecified date the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court, in which he noted the already accepted value of the dispute as MKD 1,000,000.On 23 January 2014 the Supreme Court rejected the appeal on points of law as inadmissible ratione valoris, holding that the increase in value had been done in violation of the Civil Procedure Code, and therefore that the value of the dispute fell short of the statutory threshold of MKD 500,000 (around EUR 8,100). The court also found that the amount of court fees paid by the plaintiff corresponded to a dispute value of MKD 40,000.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complains under Articles 6 and 13 of the Convention that the rejection of his appeal on points of law amounted to a deprivation of his right of access to the Supreme Court..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

He is represented before the Court by Ms L. \u00d6zg\u00fcr and Ms \u00d6. Y\u0131lmaz, lawyers practising in \u0130zmir.At the time of the incidents, the applicant was a conscript soldier in the Turkish army. On 5 January 2001, the applicant and his squad were sent to a mountainous area for military training. In the evening, the squad went into a military trench. At around 11.30 p.m. while the applicant was sleeping in the trench, another conscript soldier whom the applicant could not identify because of the snow masks they were all wearing stepped on his left arm. The applicant felt his left arm numb and could not sleep because of the pain. Meanwhile his arm became swollen and in the morning when they returned to their regiment, the applicant was suffering and hardly able to walk. However, he could not ask to see a doctor before the roll call. On 6 January 2001 at around 8.00 p.m. the applicant complained about his injury to the commanding officer, who sent him to the regiment infirmary. The doctor at the infirmary did not examine him carefully and told him that he might have been bitten by an insect. On the same day he was transferred to \u0130zmir Military Hospital, where he was examined by two different doctors who each made a different diagnosis although neither of them was an orthopaedist. One of the doctors who examined the applicant called the orthopaedist who was on duty and according to the orthopaedist\u2019s instructions given by phone, an x-ray was made of the applicant\u2019s arm. The applicant was then sent to have a splint applied to his arm. The person at the military hospital who applied the splint to the applicant\u2019s arm was not medically trained. The applicant\u2019s next doctor\u2019s visit was scheduled for 8 January 2001. On 7 January 2001, the applicant\u2019s arm was feeling numb and still swollen; therefore he went to the regiment\u2019s infirmary. When the doctor at the infirmary examined and opened the splint, the applicant saw that there were two symmetrical violet bruises on his elbow. The doctor explained that this might become gangrenous and he ordered the splint to be loosened. However, the applicant was still suffering severely and could not sleep. On 8 January 2001, when he was still in severe physical pain, he was sent to \u0130zmir Military Hospital by military bus.On 8 January 2001, after being examined by an orthopaedist, he was hospitalised in \u0130zmir Military Hospital and placed in a room; however, he did not receive any treatment. On 9 January 2001, when a doctor visited him it was observed that a compartment syndrome had occurred because of the blood circulation deficiency. He was transferred to Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University Hospital immediately by ambulance, where he had an operation which was not enough to save his arm. On 13 January 2001 during a second operation his left arm was amputated 8 cm below his armpit.The applicant had five other operations afterwards and on 22 March 2001 he was discharged from the hospital.No disciplinary investigation was initiated into the facts surrounding the accident.On 10 April 2001, the applicant alleged that the military and/or medical staff were guilty of malpractice and medical negligence concerning the accident and the treatment. On 10 June 2001, the \u0130zmir Military Public Prosecutor decided that there was no need to initiate further proceedings. In his decision, the prosecutor stated that the military staff supervising or participating in the military training could not be held responsible for the accident. Furthermore, he noted that the military doctor in the infirmary and the military hospital staff who had examined the applicant had also conducted their duties with due diligence. It is not clear from the documents in the case file whether the applicant appealed against this decision.On the other hand, following the applicant\u2019s complaint, criminal proceedings were initiated against C.\u00d6., the orthopaedist at \u0130zmir Military Hospital, before the \u0130zmir Military Criminal Court. During the proceedings before \u0130zmir Military Criminal Court, it was revealed that the accused had retired from the military. Therefore, on 29 December 2004 the court gave a non-jurisdiction decision and referred the case file to \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First Instance. On 9 November 2006, \u0130zmir Criminal Court of First instance convicted C.\u00d6. of malpractice according to Article 459 \u00a7 2 of the Turkish Criminal Code then in force, Law No. 765. C.\u00d6. was sentenced to three months\u2019 imprisonment However, the sentence was subsequently suspended.On 5 March 2003, the applicant applied to the Supreme Military Administrative Court with a compensation request.On 18 January 2006, the Supreme Military Administrative Court rejected the applicant\u2019s request for pecuniary damage, stating that since 1 July 2002 the applicant had been granted a disability pension (200 euros (EUR) approximately per month) and partially accepted his compensation request for non-pecuniary damages and granted 20,000 Turkish Lira (TRY) (approximately EUR 7,000). On 28 June 2006 the Supreme Military Administrative Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for rectification of its decision.According to the applicant, at the time of lodging the application he had not been paid the compensation.COMPLAINTSThe applicant alleges that his right to life was breached. In this connection, he states that he was not provided with prompt and adequate treatment by competent medical staff. The applicant also alleges that the conditions surrounding the amputation of his left arm were not examined thoroughly and effectively by the Supreme Military Administrative Court.The applicant argues under Article 6 of the Convention that the Supreme Military Administrative Court, which examined the case, cannot be considered as independent or impartial. In this respect, he maintains that the two military officers who sit on the bench remain under the hierarchy of the military authorities and do not enjoy the same judicial guarantees as other military judges. The applicant further complains under the same provision that the written opinion submitted by the principal public prosecutor to the Supreme Military Administrative Court was not communicated to him, which infringed the principle of equality of arms..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court.

The court also took into account the fact that the applicant had been permanently living in the house, had assumed all maintenance costs and had no other housing. That judgment entered into force on 13 August 2015.In 2016 the applicant\u2019s wife sold the house to her mother. According to the contract of sale, persons who were registered as living in the house lost their right to live there after the transfer of the property to the new owner.On an unspecified date the new owner of the house brought eviction proceedings against the applicant.The applicant submitted to the court that he had not been aware that his former wife had sold the house to her mother.On 15 February 2017 the Town Court dismissed the eviction claim. The Town Court held, in particular, that according to the gift deed of 25 December 2000 the applicant had acquired a right to live in the house, which was not limited in time, and therefore the subsequent transfer of property rights over the house to a new owner had no impact on the applicant\u2019s right \u2013 as established in the gift deed of 25 December 2000 \u2013 to live in the house.On 27 April 2017 the Krasnodar Regional Court (\u201cthe Regional Court\u201d) quashed the judgment of 15 February 2017, and ordered the applicant\u2019s eviction without making provision for any alternative accommodation. The Regional Court held, in particular, that the applicant had not contested the contract of sale of 2016 and that that contract had not been declared null and void. The Regional Court pointed out that the Town Court had not taken into account the fact that the provisions of the contract of sale had annulled the provisions of the gift deed of 25 December 2000 and that therefore the applicant had lost his right to live in the house.On 6 June 2017 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Regional Court. He submitted, in particular, that he had been living in the house since 1997, he had assumed the maintenance of the house and he had no other housing.On 7 July 2017 a judge of the Regional Court refused to refer the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal to a court of cassation.On 18 August 2018 the applicant lodged a cassation appeal with the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation (\u201cthe Supreme Court\u201d).On 8 September 2017 a judge of the Supreme Court refused to refer the applicant\u2019s cassation appeal to the Civil Chamber of the Supreme Court for examination on the merits.On 22 May 2017 the bailiffs\u2019 service initiated enforcement proceedings.COMPLAINTThe applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention that the domestic courts ordered his eviction from his only home in breach of domestic law and without having examined his arguments against the eviction..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment.

It held that the first-instance court should have applied the USD exchange rate which had been valid on the date of the first-instance judgment, and not a different rate for each procedural action.On 4 May 2007 the Zagreb Municipal Court ordered company T. to pay the applicants a further sum of 32,123.11 Croatian kunas (HRK) in respect of the costs of the proceedings.Upon an appeal by the applicants, on 24 July 2007 the Zagreb County Court quashed the decision of the Zagreb Municipal Court and remitted the case, instructing the first-instance court to apply the USD exchange rate which had been valid on the date on which it had concluded the trial, rather than a different rate for each procedural action.On 12 April 2011 the Zagreb Municipal Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim, finding that the amount paid thus far to the applicants in respect of the costs of litigation was already sufficient, and that the relevant daily exchange rate should be applied for each procedural action.On 13 September 2011 the Zagreb County Court dismissed an appeal by the applicants and upheld the first-instance decision of 12 April 2011.The applicants then lodged an \u201cordinary\u201d appeal on points of law under section 381(1)(1) of the Civil Procedure Act and an \u201cextraordinary\u201d appeal on points of law under section 382(2) of the Civil Procedure Act.On 15 November 2011 the Supreme Court declared the applicants\u2019 appeals on points of law inadmissible. The \u201cordinary\u201d appeal was declared inadmissible by reason of the value of the claim (ratione valoris). However, no reasons were given for declaring the applicants\u2019 \u201cextraordinary\u201d appeal inadmissible.On 13 September 2012 the Constitutional Court declared a constitutional complaint by the applicants inadmissible.COMPLAINTThe applicants complain under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that their right to a fair hearing was violated when the Supreme Court declared their appeal on points of law under section 382(2) of the Civil Procedure Act inadmissible without giving adequate reasons..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant had been working in Olympic Airways from 1 March 1969 until 14 June 1974, the date on which she resigned. Pursuant to Article 5 of Law No. 76/1974, employees who had been forced to resign during the military dictatorship in Greece had the right to be reinstated following a request to the competent Minister. The Minister would issue his decision after the relevant Committee gave its opinion on whether the former employee\u2019s claims were well-founded.Following two successful applications for annulment against the Committee\u2019s negative opinions concerning the applicant\u2019s reinstatement, a third opinion was issued on 20 December 2000 according to which the applicant should be reinstated to her former post. On 27 September 2007 the competent Minister\u2019s tacit refusal to issue the decision of reinstatement was annulled by judgment no. 2713/2007 of the Supreme Administrative Court and the case was remitted to the administrative authorities.On 17 March 2009 the Minister of Transfers and Communication issued a decision by which he rejected the applicant\u2019s request for reinstatement. By judgment no. 1958/2011 the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal annulled the Minister\u2019s decision on the grounds of lack of legal reasoning and remitted the case once again to the administrative authorities. The applicant had the decision served on the Minister on 5 December 2011. From the material in the Court\u2019s possession, it appears that no actions have been taken by the Minister to comply with the last judgment.The applicant complains under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about non-execution of judgments no. 2713/2007 of the Supreme Administrative Court and no. 1958/2011 of the Athens Administrative Court of Appeal. She additionally complains under Article 13 about lack of a legal remedy in respect of her complaint under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

It agreed with the outcome of the case but held that the first-instance court misinterpreted some relevant facts.On 5 December 2011 the applicant lodged an appeal on points of law before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) challenging the judgments of the lower courts.On 14 May 2013 the Supreme Court declared the applicant\u2019s appeal on points of law inadmissible on the grounds that in fact the second-instance court dismissed his appeal on different grounds and that section 373a of the Civil Procedure Act, allowing for an appeal on points of law, was not applicable.The applicant then lodged a constitutional complaint before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske) and on 16 October 2013 the Constitutional Court declared it inadmissible as manifestly ill-founded.The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 25 October 2013.B. Relevant domestic lawThe relevant provision of the Civil Procedure Act (Zakon o parni\u010dnom postupku, Official Gazette nos. 53/1991, 91/1992, 58/1993, 112/1999, 88/2001, 117/2003, 88/2005, 2/2007, 84/2008, 123/2008, 57/2011, 148/2011, 25/2013) provides as follows:Section 382\u201cThe parties may lodge an appeal on points of law against the second-instance judgment:...3) if the second-instance judgment was based on sections 373a and 373b of this Act.... \u201cCOMPLAINTThe applicant complains under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that he did not have access to the Supreme Court..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications. For this reason, whilst the case does not significantly contribute to the development of the ECtHR's case law, it nevertheless raises a particular point of interest.\"};\n                                        Level 3 text: The application concerns an Ivorian national, who reached Malta by boat in November 2021. On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: 1. The applicants are nineteen Afghani nationals. A list of them is set out in the appendix. The applicants are represented by Ms Z. \u0160tevulov\u00e1, a lawyer at the Human Rights League in Bratislava.A. The circumstances of the case2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.3. On 17 November 2014 at 1.30 a.m. the Slovak Border and Foreigners Police (\u201cthe border police\u201d) apprehended the nineteen applicants and twelve other foreign nationals near the Ukrainian border. The applicants were taken to the border police station in Petrovce for the purpose of checking their identity.1. Police interviews(a) Course of events as described in the police transcripts4. The applicants presented the transcripts of interviews conducted by the police which indicated that all of them had been interviewed at the border police station. According to these transcripts, between 9.10 a.m. and 12.30 p.m. each applicant had undergone two interviews. Each interview had lasted exactly ten minutes and had been conducted by two police officers in the presence of an interpreter. The times of some interviews overlapped, for example between 9.20 a.m. and 9.30 a.m. two police officers were recorded as present at three different interviews at the same time. The signature of the same interpreter appears on all these interview transcripts. During the interviews, the police had primarily been seeking information about the irregular entry of the applicants from the territory of Ukraine. The questions were standardised and most of the applicants\u2019 answers had been identical. According to the police transcripts, all the applicants had answered in the negative when asked whether they had suffered persecution in their country of origin and whether they wished to seek asylum in Slovakia.(b) Course of events as described by the applicants5. The applicants maintained that the border police had interviewed only a few of them and that the others had been handed documents for signature without being interviewed at all. They maintained that the police had not properly identified all the applicants, that the names of some applicants had been misspelled and in three cases the date of birth had been indicated only by a year. Applicant number 10, who was fifteen years old at the time, had been misidentified as an adult.6. Furthermore, the applicants stated that there had been only one interpreter who had been present at the police station for only a few hours. Judged objectively, the interpreter could not have been present at all the interviews recorded in the transcripts because he would have to have been in different places at the same time. The applicants maintained that the interpreter had come into the cell and told them that they would be transferred to a refugee camp and had then asked them to sign documents of unknown content in the Slovak language, which he had not translated. The applicants had signed the documents as they thought they were related to their asylum requests.7. The applicants had been given no information about the asylum procedure in Slovakia. They maintained that they had repeatedly approached police officers with their requests for asylum but the police had ignored their requests. Some of the applicants had asked for legal assistance and had requested contact with the UNHCR but had received no response from the police.2. Decisions on administrative expulsion8. On 17 November 2014, the same date as their apprehension, the border police issued nineteen separate administrative expulsion decisions. They all included a three-year ban on re-entering Slovak territory. The basis for the expulsions was irregular border crossing and the applicants were to be returned to Ukraine. None of the decisions included a period for voluntary departure pursuant to section 83 of the Aliens Act (Law no. 404/2011 Coll., as amended). In all the decisions the suspensive effect of possible appeal was excluded on the grounds of urgent public interest pursuant to section 55(2) of the Administrative Proceedings Act (Law no. 71/1967 Coll., as amended). The texts of the decisions were almost identical, the only difference being in the amounts of money the applicants had had in their possession.9. The same day at around 10.30 p.m. all the applicants were expelled to Ukraine.10. The applicants maintained that they had not been given copies of the administrative expulsion decisions whilst still on Slovak territory. They had obtained copies of these decisions only later by authorising their current legal representative to inspect the files.3. Developments after expulsion to Ukraine11. In Ukraine, the applicants were placed in the temporary detention facility in Chop. On 25 November 2015, applicants 1 to 4 instructed a lawyer and lodged an appeal against the administrative expulsion decisions. On 7 January 2015, the Slovak border police dismissed their appeals.12. The rest of the applicants were not able to contact a lawyer until their transfer to the Volynskiy detention centre on 10 and 25 December 2014 respectively. No appeals were lodged.B. Relevant domestic law and practice1. Police Corps Act 1993 (Law no. 171/1993 Coll., as amended)13. Pursuant to sections 18(3) and (4), the police can take a person to a police station for the purposes of verifying his or her identity if that person is unable credibly to prove his or her name and surname, date of birth and place of residence. Section 17(1) authorises the police to seek explanations, where required, from anyone who can contribute to the clarification of facts that are of importance in uncovering a misdemeanour or administrative offence and its perpetrator, or facts of importance in tracking down missing or wanted persons or items.2. Asylum Act (Law no. 480/2002 Coll., as amended)14. According to section 3(1) asylum proceedings are commenced by a declaration by the individual concerned to the competent police department that he or she is applying for asylum or subsidiary protection on the territory of the Slovak Republic. If a foreigner requests asylum after entering the territory of the Slovak Republic, the authority competent to receive the asylum request is the police department established at the asylum facility (section 3(2)(b)). If the foreigner applies for asylum at a police department not competent to receive the asylum request, that police department is obliged to inform the applicant of the competent police department and provide the applicant with a travel document valid for twenty-four hours or, alternatively, may decide that he or she should be detained (section 3(8)).3. Aliens Act (Law no. 404/2011 Coll., as amended)15. The border police can authorise the administrative expulsion of a third\u2011country national if he or she has irregularly crossed the external border, or if he or she intentionally avoids or refuses to undergo the border control when crossing the external border (section 82(1)(a)).16. A third-country national regarding whom an administrative expulsion decision has been made is obliged to leave the territory before the period for voluntary departure set out in the expulsion decision, which should fall between seven and thirty days later. If it is deemed likely that the person in question might escape or otherwise obstruct or hinder the exercise of administrative expulsion, and in particular if the person\u2019s identity cannot be verified, the police need not establish any period for voluntary departure (section 83 (1) and (2)(a)).4. Administrative Proceedings Act (Law no. 71/1967 Coll., as amended)17. An appeal can be lodged against an administrative expulsion decision within fifteen days of notification thereof (sections 53 and 54(2)).18. An appeal lodged against an administrative decision before expiry of the time-limit has suspensive effect unless provided otherwise. The administrative authority may exclude the suspensive effect if urgent public interest so requires, or if there is a risk that by suspending enforcement of the decision a party to the proceedings or a third person might suffer irreparable damage. The basis for such urgency must be properly reasoned (section 55(2)).C. Relevant international documents19. The relevant international documents are listed in Sharifi and Others v. Italy and Greece, no. 16643/09, \u00a7\u00a7 49 53, 21 October 2014.20. In a 124-page report published in December 2010 and entitled \u201cBuffeted in the Borderland. The Treatment of Asylum Seekers and Migrants in Ukraine\u201d, Human Rights Watch described the results of their research into the experience of migrants and asylum seekers who had been returned to Ukraine from Hungary and Slovakia. The report states that \u201caccording to the bilateral agreements, migrants caught entering Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary without permission can be summarily returned if caught within 48 hours of crossing. The launching of an appeal in Slovakia and Hungary does not suspend the return and returnees do not have access to minimal information on arrest and return. In practice, Human Rights Watch found that migrants were often tricked into believing they would not be returned, were asked to sign papers they did not understand, and were not always given an opportunity to contact a lawyer, NGOs, or UNHCR.\u201d Specifically with regard to Slovakia, Human Rights Watch stated that \u201cthe most common complaint heard from migrants who had been returned from Slovakia was that their asylum claims were ignored and that they were treated in summary fashion, quickly sent back within hours of apprehension in Slovakia with little opportunity to make any claim to remain.\u201dCOMPLAINTS1. The applicants complain under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 that their expulsion to Ukraine was collective in nature. In particular, they allege that the State authorities did not carry out individual assessment and examination of their cases and that they were denied access to the asylum procedure.2. Relying on Article 13 in connection with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, the applicants complain that they had no effective remedy through which to challenge their expulsion to Ukraine..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O.

He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B.

Ekimdzhiev, Ms K. Boncheva and Ms G. Chernicherska, is set out in the appendix.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.Ancestors of the applicants owned a plot of land of 246 square metres with a two-storey house built on it in the old part of Plovdiv. In 1949 the building was declared a cultural monument and in 1966 the property was expropriated against the payment of compensation. After that the building was the subject of renovation works, in particular after a fire destroyed a part of it in 1978.After the adoption of the Restitution of Property Expropriated under Building Planning Legislation Act in 1992 (\u201cthe 1992 Act\u201d, see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below), some of the applicants and other heirs of the initial owners (from whom the remaining applicants succeeded in the course of the proceedings) applied for the revocation of the expropriation. On 28 June 1993 they were informed that their application had been rejected by the mayor of Plovdiv and on 7 July 1993 they applied for judicial review. In a judgment of 9 October 1997 the Plovdiv Regional Court upheld the administrative decision. However, the decision was quashed by the Supreme Administrative Court which reversed on appeal, in a final judgment of 2 October 1998.The Supreme Administrative Court found that the preconditions for restitution had been satisfied, because the property existed still and, in addition, no \u201cpublic works\u201d within the meaning of the 1992 Act had been commenced because the renovation works carried out after the expropriation had only been aimed at the building\u2019s preservation and had not been a part of the implementation of urban development plans. On this basis, the Supreme Administrative Court revoked the expropriation.Following the above judgment, on 21 May 1999 the applicants paid back to the municipality the monetary compensation received by their ancestors at the time of expropriation.In 2001 they obtained a notary deed, indicating them as the property\u2019s owners.Despite the developments above, the applicants could not enter into possession, because the property continued to be occupied by the Plovdiv municipality, together with an organisation called \u201c13 Centuries Bulgaria\u201d National Endowment Fund (\u201cthe Fund\u201d, see \u201cRelevant domestic law\u201d below). After attempting unsuccessfully to negotiate a solution with these bodies, on 31 December 2003 the applicants brought against them rei vindicatio proceedings.The action was dismissed in a final judgment of the Supreme Court of Cassation of 8 June 2007. The courts found, in the first place, that they were competent to examine the action. According to the second-instance Plovdiv Regional Court, the judgment of 2 October 1998 could be subject to indirect judicial review, because it was replacing the mayor\u2019s administrative decision on the applicants\u2019 request for restitution and did not have a res judicata effect in proceedings whereby a civil dispute concerning the right to property was examined. On the other hand, according to the Supreme Court of Cassation the defendants to the rei vindicatio action, namely the Plovdiv municipality and the Fund, had not participated in the earlier judicial proceedings and were thus not bound by the judgment of 2 October 2007.The courts found, next, that the reparation works carried out in the building claimed by the applicants had been so substantial (its appearance had been preserved, but the internal construction had been largely modified; the roof, some windows and other elements had also been changed) that it could not be said that the building existed, within the meaning of the 1992 Act. In addition, the property was being used for the purpose and the \u201cpublic works\u201d it had been expropriated for, namely \u201ca cultural monument\u201d.

It provided, in section 1(1), for the revocation of previous expropriations and the restitution of property where certain criteria had been met, in particular where the public works for which the property had been expropriated had not commenced and where any buildings on the property were still existing at the time of the Act\u2019s entry into force.The applicants have submitted two judgments (\u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 805 \u043e\u0442 8 \u0430\u043f\u0440\u0438\u043b 1994 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 160/93 \u0433., \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u0433. \u043e.; \u0420\u0435\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u2116 460 \u043e\u0442 15 \u0434\u0435\u043a\u0435\u043c\u0432\u0440\u0438 1993 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 2171/92 \u0433., \u0406\u0406\u0406 \u0433. \u043e.), where the former Supreme Court of Bulgaria found that the \u201cpublic works\u201d within the meaning of section 1(1) of the Act always involved the demolition of the expropriated building; where the building was standing, even with substantial improvements carried out after the expropriation, it could not be considered that the preconditions for restitution were not met.The 1992 Act provided further that where the previous owner had received monetary compensation at the time of expropriation, restitution would only take effect upon repayment of the sum received (section 6(1)).A request for the revocation of expropriation had to be addressed to the mayor of the municipality, whose refusal (express or tacit) was amenable to judicial review.2.

The Fund is governed by a board, which includes the ministers of culture, health, education and labour. One of them is selected by the Council of Ministers to serve as the board\u2019s president. The remaining members of the board are appointed by the Council of Ministers upon a proposal by the Prime Minister. Apart from donations, the Fund\u2019s activities are also financed by the State budget.3. Provisions concerning the res judicata effect of final judgmentsThe relevant provisions have been summarised in the Court\u2019s judgment in the cases of in the case of Kehaya and Others v.

The applicants rely on the Court\u2019s findings in the case of Kehaya and Others, cited above. They argue, in addition, that the provision of section 1(1) of the 1992 Act was unclear as to the exact meaning of the conditions for restitution.The applicants also complain under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 that the national courts\u2019 judgments in the rei vindicatio proceedings unlawfully deprived them of property acquired pursuant to the judgment of 2 October 1998.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications. For this reason, whilst the case does not significantly contribute to the development of the ECtHR's case law, it nevertheless raises a particular point of interest.\"};\n                                        Level 3 text: The application concerns an Ivorian national, who reached Malta by boat in November 2021. On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Mr Dmitriy Yuryevich Belugin, is a Russian national who was born in 1976 and lives in Tomsk.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.1. Criminal proceedings against the applicant(a) Victim Ko.On an unspecified date, criminal proceedings were instituted concerning an assault against Mr Ko.It follows from the document entitled \u201cSpontaneous confession\u201d (\u00ab\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439\u00bb), dated 25 December 2002 and compiled at 9 p.m., that the applicant \u201ccame to the police station\u201d and voluntarily made self\u2011incriminating statements in relation to Ko.\u2019s case. No lawyer was present during the recording of the confession.According to the applicant, at or around noon on 25 December 2002 he was arrested on suspicion of assault against Mr Ko., and was taken to a police station. In the applicant\u2019s submission, from noon to 9 p.m. he was not provided with legal assistance and was beaten up (in an unspecified way) by officers of the Organised Crime Unit.Apparently, the arrest record was compiled at 9.20 p.m. From that time, the applicant was treated as a suspect in a criminal case, who could benefit from the guarantees under various provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CCrP), including those relating to (mandatory) legal assistance (see \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below).A lawyer was admitted to the case, under Articles 49-51 of the CCrP.At 9.55 p.m. the applicant was interviewed as a suspect, in the presence of this lawyer. The applicant confirmed his earlier confession. The interview was recorded on video. The interview record indicates that (apparently before the interview) the applicant was informed of his procedural rights in the following terms:\u201c... to make oral statements or testimony concerning the suspicion against him; not to make any such statement or testimony;To have recourse to legal assistance from the time indicated in paragraphs 2 and 3 of [illegible] of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to see counsel in private before the first interview ... I have been informed that under Article 51 of the Convention I am not obliged to make statements against myself ...\u201dThe above document was signed by the applicant and the lawyer.Around midnight the applicant was taken to the crime scene. This investigative measure was recorded on video. It is unclear whether it was carried out in the presence of a lawyer.(b) Victim Kol.In 2001 criminal proceedings were instituted in relation to murder of Mr Kol. Apparently the proceedings were suspended due to the absence of a suspect.It follows from the document entitled \u201cSpontaneous confession\u201d, dated 26 December 2002, that the applicant \u201ccame to the police station\u201d and made a written statement admitting to a robbery and murdering Mr Kol. No lawyer was present when the applicant made this confession.(c) Subsequent proceedingsFrom 25 to 27 December 2002 the applicant was kept in the Organised Crime Unit (in the police station) or in the temporary detention centre of Seversk.On 27 December 2002 the applicant was brought before a judge who ordered his release. On the same day, the applicant came to an investigator and was arrested. Apparently, the applicant resisted his interrogation by the police and handcuffing, claiming access to \u201chis lawyer\u201d.Allegedly, the night between 27 and 28 December 2002 the applicant was beaten up and threatened by the investigator and officers of the Organised Crime Unit.On 29 December 2002 the applicant was interviewed by an investigator and alleged that he had confessed under duress on 26 December 2002. The applicant asked to be examined by a forensic medical expert and for the seizure of the shirt he had on the day when the alleged ill-treatment had been inflicted on him.On 30 December 2002 the applicant was examined by a medical expert who concluded that the applicant had several bruises on his head.In January 2003 the applicant\u2019s mother and grandfather lodged a criminal complaint alleging ill-treatment of the applicant.On 30 January 2003 an investigator issued a refusal to institute criminal proceedings. On 6 February 2003 the applicant was given a copy of this decision. He did not seek judicial review of the above refusal under Article 125 of the CCrP.On an unspecified date, the applicant\u2019s criminal case was submitted for trial before the Tomsk Regional Court. The applicant pleaded not guilty to all charges. One of the co-defendants, Mr Ku., pleaded guilty and made incriminating statements against the other co-defendants, including the applicant. Co-defendant Kash. also made incriminating statements against the applicant.On 18 January 2005 the trial court heard witness K., who stated that the applicant had been arrested in the morning on 25 December 2002 and that he had no visible bodily injuries.According to the applicant, in the meantime, on 21 January and 16 September 2005 he lodged separate complaints before the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office alleging unlawful deprivation of liberty on 25 December 2002 and asking for institution of criminal proceedings for this reason. The outcome of these proceedings remains unclear.By a judgment of 9 June 2006 the Regional Court convicted the applicant and his co-defendants of murder and robberies. The court sentenced the applicant to twenty year of imprisonment (to be counted from 25 December 2002, the day of the applicant\u2019s arrest).In its judgment, the Regional Court considered that since the applicant\u2019s arrest on 25 December 2002 was unrelated to the case for which he spontaneously came forward with a confession (Mr Kol.\u2019s case), there was no reason to consider him, at the time, as a suspect in that case (meaning that the requirement of legal assistance did not apply). The court also noted that the confession was corroborated by the incriminating statements made by the applicant\u2019s co-accused Mr Kash. and Mr Ku.The trial court also heard a court registrar, who had been present at the detention hearing on 27 December 2002 (see above). She stated that the defence had not raised any complaint of ill-treatment at that hearing, that she recalled the circumstances of the hearing but did not remember to have seen any bruises on the applicant\u2019s face or head on that day.The trial court also examined a certificate, which had been issued by the temporary detention centre on an unspecified date and indicated that the applicant had had no injuries on 25-27 December 2002. Furthermore, the court heard three police officers and an investigator who stated that on 27 December 2002 physical force and restraints had been used against the applicant, who behaved in a violent manner.Referring to the above evidence, as well as the interview video recording of 26 December 2002, the trial court dismissed as unsubstantiated the applicant\u2019s allegation that his confession in Mr Kol.\u2019s case had been given voluntarily and was truthful. The trial court also dismissed the allegation of duress in relation to the applicant\u2019s confession Mr Ko.\u2019s case \u201cfor the same reasons as in Kol.\u2019s case\u201d.The applicant appealed against the judgment of 9 June 2006. On 8 April 2008 the Supreme Court of Russia upheld this judgment.2. Proceedings before the CourtThe applicant\u2019s letter dated 31 October 2005 was dispatched by the staff of Tomsk remand centre no. 70/1 on 21 December 2005.The completed application form was submitted by the applicant on 14 March 2006.B.

Arrest and suspect\u2019s procedural rightsArticle 46 of the CCrP provided, at the relevant time (December 2002), for the procedural rights from the moment of arrest of a suspect (\u0437\u0430\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0436\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0437\u0440\u0435\u0432\u0430\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u043e), including the following rights: to be informed of the suspicion against him; to receive a copy of the decision to initiate criminal proceedings against him or a copy of the arrest record; to make a deposition in relation to the suspicion against him or to remain silent; to have legal assistance from the moment indicated in Article 49 \u00a7 3 (2) and (3) of the Code; and to have a confidential meeting with counsel before the first interview.According to Article 49 of the CCrP, counsel had to participate in a criminal case from the initiation of criminal proceedings against a named person, from the time of the arrest of a suspect in situations described in Articles 91 and 92 of the Code, or when detention of the suspect had been ordered under Article 100 of the Code.Article 49 also provided that an advocate could be admitted as counsel in a criminal case from the moment when a suspect was apprehended with due regard to Article 91 and 92 of the Code, or when he was remanded in custody under Article 100 of the Code.It followed from Article 50 of the CCrP that a suspect could retain counsel or have it appointed by the investigating or prosecuting authority. Under Article 51 participation of counsel was mandatory unless the suspect waived his right to legal assistance. It was mandatory in cases concerning an eventual sentence beyond fifteen year\u2019s imprisonment. In such a situation counsel should be retained by the suspect or appointed by the investigating or prosecuting authority, following the procedure under Article 49 of the Code.Article 92 of the CCrP required that after the suspect had been arrested he should be brought (\u0434\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435) before an investigating authority or a prosecutor. No later than three hours after this an arrest record should be compiled together with a notice that the suspect had been informed of his rights under Article 46 of the Code. The suspect should be interviewed, and before such interviews, he should, if requested, be afforded an opportunity to have a meeting with counsel.2. Investigation of allegations of criminal offencesArticle 144 of the CCrP provided that an investigator or a prosecutor was required to deal with a complaint alleging a criminal offence or a voluntary and spontaneous confession (\u00ab\u044f\u0432\u043a\u0430 \u0441 \u043f\u043e\u0432\u0438\u043d\u043d\u043e\u0439\u00bb). Such procedure led to a decision to institute or not to institute criminal proceedings (Article 145).When criminal proceedings were instituted, the investigating or prosecuting authority was required to open a preliminary investigation and was empowered to carry out various investigative measures indicated in Article 150-226 of the CCrP, such as search and seizure, telephone tapping, interrogation, confrontation or identification.COMPLAINTS1. The applicant complains under Article 3 of the Convention that he was beaten up on 25 and 26 December 2002. He also complains that on 27\u201128 December 2002 he was beaten up again and that he was kept in appalling conditions.2. The applicant complains under Articles 5, 6 and 13 of the Convention that the arrest record was not drawn up within three hours after his arrest and that he was not provided with legal assistance, that he was wrongly convicted on the basis of unlawfully-obtained evidence, including his own confessions, and that he was forced to incriminate himself..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The application concerns the quashing of a final judgment in favour of the applicant by the Supreme Court of Justice after accepting an appeal on points law which was allegedly lodged outside the legal time-limit.The applicant complains that the quashing of the final judgment in such circumstances was contrary to the principle of legal certainty and breached his rights guaranteed by Article 6 \u00a7 1 and Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand.

The receptionist called the police. The police arrived by car. As the applicant had in the meantime left the hotel, two police officers followed him and ordered him to get into the car. Subsequently he was taken back to the hotel where the receptionist identified him. Later on he was taken to the police station in Krasnystaw. When he was getting out of the car, he was pushed and shoved. At the police station he was handcuffed behind his back. The other police officer hit him with a truncheon. He was subsequently beaten again. The police took him to the sobering-up centre. On the way to the sobering-up centre, in the police car, he was beaten again. He was thrown on the floor face down and the two police officers trampled on him, stepped on his buttocks and kicked him many times. Later on, a breathalyser test was taken. It showed 0.34 ml of alcohol per litre. He was then placed in restraining belts until the morning of 28 September 2008 when he was released.After his release he went to a doctor. He submitted a medical certificate (obdukcja) dated 29 September 2008. It reads as follows:\u201cOn 27 September 2008 around 9 p.m. Tomasz Pokrzywka suffered injuries as a result of a beating. The victim has stated that he was hit in the stomach and legs, then knocked over and trampled on. An examination revealed bruises on his right and left temple and on his right cheekbone, bruise on his right elbow and left knee. On palpation, pain in left underbelly. Pain and swelling of the right testicle. X-ray of cranium and left knee have not shown any trauma. Conclusion: Injuries have caused dysfunction of the applicant\u2019s body for a period less than 7 days. They could have originated in the circumstances as described by the victim.\u201dOn 1 October 2008 the applicant was admitted to a hospital in Krasnystaw. He reported the ill-treatment by the police.On 2 October 2008 he was operated on in connection with a post-traumatic haematoma of his scrotum and rupture of the left testicle (p\u0119kni\u0119cie lewego j\u0105dra). He was discharged from the hospital on 8 October 2008.Subsequently the prosecution authorities carried out an investigation into his allegations of ill-treatment.By a decision of 31 March 1009 the Jan\u00f3w Lubelski District Prosecutor discontinued the investigation. It was established that the applicant had been arrested by two police officers as he had committed a breach of public order in the hotel. As he had been aggressive, he had to be physically restrained and had been hit with a truncheon. He had subsequently been handcuffed and taken to the Krasnystaw police station. As he had still been aggressive and apparently drunk, a decision had been taken to take him to the sobering-up centre. In the car he had been aggressive, banging his head against the car\u2019s sides. At the sobering-up centre a breathalyser test had shown that the applicant had 0.34 mg of alcohol per litre of blood. He had been strapped to a bed as he had been aggressive. He was released in the morning of 28 September 2008. Upon his release he had not made any complaints. On 29 September 2008 the applicant went to see a forensic doctor who established his injuries (as per the certificate quoted above). On 1 October 2008 the applicant had been admitted to Krasnystaw hospital complaining about having been beaten up. He was subsequently operated on. A haematoma in his scrotum was evacuated and a ruptured testicle was stitched.The court referred to an additional opinion prepared by forensic experts for the purposes of the investigation. The experts had found that the applicant\u2019s injuries had caused a dysfunction of his body for a period longer than 7 days. They had found that the injuries could have been caused by kicking, by falling on a hard surface or by a police truncheon. The injury to his testicle could have been caused by kicking. As the applicant had stated that in the police car the police officers had been trampling on his body and stepping on his buttocks while he lay on the floor face down, the injury could not have been caused by their actions.The prosecutor further referred to the records of the sobering-up centre which did not show that the applicant had complained about any injuries upon his release. It further noted that the use of force by the police had been recorded in an official note. That note referred to the applicant\u2019s aggressive behaviour in that he had been banging his head against the interior side of the car. The court concluded that the available evidence did not support a conclusion that the injuries had been caused by a disproportionate use of force by the police.The applicant appealed, submitting that the prosecuting authorities had discontinued the investigation despite the fact that the expert opinion indicated that his injuries could have been caused by the applicant being kicked in the scrotum.On 26 June 2009 the Krasnystaw District Court upheld the prosecutor\u2019s decision. It was of the view that it was correct and that its conclusion that the injury could not have been caused by the police\u2019s conduct described by the applicant (the officers stepping on his buttocks while he had been lying face down) had to be upheld.The applicant complained to the Ministry of Justice. He complained that he had been ill-treated by the police and that the authorities had conducted a very superficial examination of his case. Subsequently, the investigation was resumed.His mother, his father and his friend were questioned. They confirmed that the applicant had come back home on 28 September 2008 with injuries which corresponded to his version of events. He had complained about having been beaten up by the police. His testicle had been swollen. He had had difficulty walking. He had told his parents that he had been hit in the stomach with a truncheon and that the officers had stepped on his buttocks when he had been lying face down in the car.On 1 June 2010 the Jan\u00f3w Lubelski District Prosecutor discontinued the proceedings again. She reiterated the factual findings of the first decision and its reasoning. She noted that at the sobering-up centre the applicant had remained strapped to a bed until 3.25 a.m. It was further reiterated that the injuries suffered by the applicant did not correspond to the police\u2019s conduct as described. The prosecutor observed that the doctors at the sobering-up centre had not recorded any complaints on the applicant\u2019s part. She further referred to the opinion of 29 September 2008 submitted by the applicant and to his medical record made at the time of his admission to the hospital on 1 October 2008. She noted that on the former date the applicant did not have any bruises on his chest, but that he did have bruises on the latter date. She was of the view that the injury to the applicant\u2019s scrotum must have been caused by an unknown person during the period from 27 to 29 September.The applicant appealed. He essentially argued that the use of force against him had been disproportionate. He submitted that the records of the sobering-up centre were not accurate as he must have already had bruises at the time of his discharge.On 24 September 2010 the Krasnystaw District Court upheld the contested decision, essentially agreeing with the prosecutor\u2019s conclusions. It reiterated that the available evidence had not made it possible to establish the circumstances in which the applicant had suffered his injuries.COMPLAINTThe applicant complains, referring to Article 3 of the Convention, that he was ill-treated by the police. The first investigation conducted was very superficial. It was only when the case was re-examined that the authorities questioned his family. The authorities considered that the testimony given by the police was credible but did not explain why evidence indicating that the applicant had been ill-treated should not be taken into consideration. The use of force against him was manifestly disproportionate. He complains that he was tied up by straps at the sobering-up centre, which had caused him considerable pain and he was unable to use the toilet for several..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C.

Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful.

Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force.

Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

He is represented before the Court by Mr E. Doki\u010d, a lawyer practising in Piran.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.The applicant was married to X. They had a daughter, Y, born in 1987. By a judgment issued on 30 September 1988, the Koper Basic Court (a) granted a divorce between the applicant and X; (b) awarded X the custody of Y; (c) granted the applicant contact rights; and (d) ordered the applicant to make regular child maintenance payments of 500,000 Yugoslav dinars from 1 October 1988 in cash directly to X.Subsequently, the applicant moved to Australia. On 30 November 1994 he notified the Piran Administrative Unit of his new address in Australia.On an unspecified date X lodged a substitute child maintenance claim on behalf of Y with the Public Guarantee and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia (hereinafter \u201cthe Maintenance Fund\u201d). By a decision of 11 July 2001 the Maintenance Fund granted substitute child maintenance to Y of 14,860 Slovenian tolars (approximately 62 euros (EUR)) from 1 November 2001. On 12 October 2001 the decision became enforceable.By a letter of 15 November 2001 sent to the applicant\u2019s address in Piran the Maintenance Fund informed the applicant about the first payment of the substitute child maintenance.On 12 November 2004 the Maintenance Fund initiated enforcement proceedings against the applicant requesting the reimbursement of 683,712 Slovenian tolars (approximately 2,853 EUR) in respect of the substitute child maintenance it had paid from 1 November 2001 to 31 October 2004. On 1 April 2005 the Piran Local Court issued an enforcement order. According to the applicant, the enforcement order was sent only to his address in Piran.On 6 April 2010, after being informed of the enforcement proceedings, the applicant lodged an objection. He complained that the enforcement order had not been served on him as he no longer lived in Piran. Moreover, he had not been informed of the transfer of the child maintenance claim to the Maintenance Fund. The applicant stressed that he had communicated his new address in Australia to the Piran Administrative Unit and that the Maintenance Fund could have easily obtained it. The applicant submitted that X had unlawfully obtained the decision on the substitute child maintenance and that it had been made despite the fact that he had been paying child maintenance and had even exceeded his child maintenance obligation. The applicant maintained that he had made the following payments: on 27 January 2003 EUR 5,000; on 14 March 2003 EUR 9,993; on 4 February 2004 EUR 49,950; on 5 February 2004 EUR 4,990; and on 26 June 2006 EUR 5,000. The applicant pointed out that he had been making payments even before 2003. For example, in 2002 he had given EUR 12,000 in cash to the child. In order to prove those submissions, the applicant submitted bank slips showing that the above-mentioned payments had been made to Y\u2019s bank account. He also requested to be heard and for Y\u2019s bank account to be checked.On 14 April 2010 the Piran Local Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s objection. The court held that a child maintenance debtor had no locus standi in proceedings concerning a transfer of a child maintenance claim to the Maintenance Fund. Those proceedings concerned only the child\u2019s right to financial support. The notice of a transfer of a child maintenance claim could only have affected the Maintenance Fund\u2019s right to claim reimbursement if the applicant had proved that he had fulfilled his obligation to pay child maintenance. However, the applicant had neither alleged nor shown that he had been paying child maintenance to X in accordance with the 1988 judgment. The bank slips submitted by the applicant indeed showed that payments had been made to Y\u2019s account, however, there was no indication of the reason for the payments or the person who had made them.On 28 October 2010 the applicant appealed. Firstly, he pointed out that the Maintenance Fund\u2019s decision of 11 July 2001 had never been served on him so he had had no opportunity to prove that he had fulfilled his obligation. Moreover, according to the applicant, the bank slips submitted to the court clearly proved that he had been paying child maintenance. By refusing to admit the evidence proposed by the applicant, the court had violated procedural rules. It had further prevented the applicant from objecting effectively and had violated his right to a remedy. Lastly, the applicant submitted that proceedings for enforcement should have been instituted against X as she had deceived the Maintenance Fund by claiming that the applicant had not been paying child maintenance.On 17 September 2010 the Koper Higher Court dismissed the appeal. It acknowledged that the Maintenance Fund was obliged by law to inform the applicant of the transfer of the child maintenance obligation. However, the rationale behind that obligation was simply to prevent the debtor and the Maintenance Fund from paying child maintenance at the same time. If that had been the case, the applicant could have objected to the Maintenance Fund\u2019s claim. However, the applicant had alleged that he had made payments to the child\u2019s account, not directly to the mother in cash as determined in the 1988 judgment. Since the applicant had neither alleged nor shown that he had correctly performed his child maintenance obligation, the local court had not been obliged to admit the evidence he had proposed.On 28 October 2010 the applicant lodged a constitutional complaint, reiterating his previous complaints. He further complained about the arbitrariness of the Higher Court\u2019s reasoning that he had not fulfilled his obligation properly by not making cash payments to his former wife. The applicant stressed that his daughter\u2019s bank account had been administered by X as her legal guardian. Therefore, even if the payment had not been made strictly in accordance with the judgment of 1988, X had indeed received child maintenance. Section 280(1) of the Obligations Act clearly stated that an obligation had to be performed to the creditor or a person designated by law, a court ruling or contract between the creditor and debtor, or a person designated by the creditor alone. That provision gave the applicant the possibility to pay child maintenance either to the child or to the mother.On 6 January 2011 the Constitutional Court dismissed the constitutional complaint, finding that it did not concern an important constitutional question or entail a violation of human rights that had serious consequences for the applicant. On 11 January 2011 the Constitutional Court\u2019s decision was served on the applicant.B. Relevant domestic lawSection 123 of the Marriage and Family Relations Act (\u201cthe MFR Act\u201d) states that parents are obliged to support their children until they reach the age of majority by providing the living conditions needed for a child\u2019s development, according to their abilities and capacity. If a child is engaged in full-time schooling, even if he or she is enrolled in ongoing part-time studies, the parents are obliged to support him or her after he or she has reached the age of majority, but only up to the age of twenty six.The MFR Act further states that minors shall be represented by their parents (Section 107(1)). Minors who have reached the age of fifteen can themselves conclude legal transactions, unless otherwise determined by law. The approval of the parents is required to make such transactions valid if they are of such an importance as to influence the life of the minor in its essentials, or if they are such that they may also influence their life after reaching the age of majority (Section 108). A child\u2019s property is to be administered by the parents in the child\u2019s interests until the child\u2019s full legal age (Section 109). A minor who has reached the age of fifteen and is employed may dispose of his or her own personal income, being at the same obliged to contribute to his or her subsistence and education (Section 112).According to the Public Guarantee and Maintenance Fund of the Republic of Slovenia Act (Official Gazette no. 10/98 of 12 February 1998 with further amendments; \u201cthe GMF\u201d) a child is entitled to substitute maintenance where it has been granted under a final court ruling, provided that the child is not yet eighteen years old and is a national of the Republic of Slovenia and permanently resident there, or is a foreigner permanently resident in Slovenia and covered by an appropriate bilateral international agreement or reciprocal arrangement (Section 21a). A child is entitled to substitute maintenance if enforcement proceedings have been unsuccessful or have been ongoing for over three months (Section 21c(1)).The GMF further states that the right to substitute maintenance shall cease, inter alia, at the request of the child maintenance debtor, provided that he proves that he has made the maintenance payments due and that he has also made further payments of child maintenance for two months in advance (Section 21f). The child\u2019s claim against the maintenance debtor is transferred to the Maintenance Fund up to an amount granted under the GMF on the day the decision granting rights under the Act is executed (Section 28(1)). Upon transferring the claim the Fund enters into the position of a creditor up to the amount paid under the decision to grant an entitlement under the GMF (Section 28(3)). The Fund shall immediately inform the maintenance debtor of the transfer of the maintenance claim (Section 28(4)).Section 280 of the Obligations Act (Official Gazette no. 83/01 of 25 October 2001) provides that an obligation must be performed to the creditor or a person designated by law, a court ruling or contract between the creditor and debtor, or as designated by the creditor alone. Performance will also be considered valid when made for a third person if the creditor subsequently approves of such performance or makes use of it.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complains in substance under Article 6 of the Convention that he was unable to effectively present his case as the 2001 decision on substitute child maintenance and the 2004 enforcement order were never served on him and consequently he was unable to prove that he had been paying child maintenance. The applicant further complains that the evidence he proposed was rejected without a valid justification. He also contests the domestic courts\u2019 interpretation that he had not adequately fulfilled his obligation by making payments in cash directly to the mother of his child as arbitrary and unfounded, considering that the mother had accepted the payments..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

It is represented before the Court by Mr G. Lansky, a lawyer practising in Vienna.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant company, may be summarised as follows.The broadcastOn 19 November 2007 the applicant company aired a broadcast within the framework of a society programme that showed the then Minister for Health, Families and Youth, A. K., and her partner, P.I., entering a restaurant in Mayerling. The report concerned mainly the minister\u2019s presence at the charity event \u2013 the presentation of contemporary art in a gourmet restaurant and the sale of towels for the benefit of women in cycling. The commentary referred to the minister\u2019s own planned cooking book on roast pork and the chef\u2019s creations for the evening.However, the report started with the minister arriving; at her side her new partner. The introductory commentary stated that they were currently Austria\u2019s most observed couple, but rarely appeared in public together. However, that evening the divorced minister and her new partner, P.I., manager at the Austrian railways, came together to the H. restaurant in Mayerling to \u201cdo good and eat well\u201d.Overlaying images of the couple entering the restaurant and A.K. greeting people, the voice over continued stating that A.K. looked fabulous and did not show of the turbulences she had successfully left behind in 2007. However, P.I., the new man at her side, was not entirely prepared with regard to the media\u2019s interest: P.I. was in his early thirties, division manager at a company of the Austrian railways and in the middle of divorce proceedings. Because of the pending court proceedings P.I. did not want to pose officially next to his new love.The images showed P.I. entering next to A.K., later stepping aside and stroking a puppy. A.K. also cuddled the puppy and expressed her love for animals in the direction of the camera.The proceedings under the Media ActOn 19 December 2007 P.I. lodged an action under section 7 of the Media Act (Mediengesetz) claiming that the commentary stating that \u201cP.I. was the new man at A.K.\u2019s side\u201d, that \u201che was in the middle of divorce proceedings\u201d and that \u201cbecause of the pending proceedings he did not want to pose at his new partner\u2019s side\u201d had violated his most intimate personal sphere.On 26 March 2008 the Vienna Regional Court (Landesgericht f\u00fcr Strafsachen Wien) ruled that the statement that P.I. was \u201cin the middle of divorce proceedings\u201d and that according proceedings were pending compromised his most intimate personal sphere, sentenced the applicant company to pay compensation in the amount of 500 Euro and to publish the operative part of the judgment. The applicant company had also to bear the costs of the proceedings. The court however dismissed P.I.\u2019s motion to also declare the statement that he was the new man at A.K.\u2019s side and refused to pose with his new love as compromising his privacy.The court established that already in summer 2007 media reported on A.K.\u2019s new relationship. It had also been reported in the print media that P.I. was still married at the time and that divorce proceedings were pending. P.I. had however lodged proceedings under the Media Act against those publications in at least thirteen cases with the said court alone. P.I. never gave interviews on his personal situation and did not pose for press photographs together with A.K. P.I. had been seen in public together with A.K. when they went out to dinner on several occasions, when they attended several smaller parties and two weddings.The court found the statement on the pending divorce proceedings to be compromising since the end of a relationship was often considered a personal failure and resulted in differing reactions from the public, ranging from pity to malice. Divorce proceedings were not public and, before the actual divorce, also not relevant for the question of personal status. The pending of divorce proceedings had thus no public consequence; only the divorce itself publicly testified on the end of a marriage. While other media had reported before the airing of the broadcast of P.I.\u2019s failed marriage, that had happened without his consent or comment. He further had objected to those reports by initiating court proceedings fighting them.As concerns the reference to the relationship between P.I. and A.K., the court found that by appearing together at the charity dinner the media could assume P.I.\u2019s consent to the reporting. That assumed consent could however in no way also include the statements on his pending divorce. The simple fact that A.K. was the Minister for Health, Families and Youth did not suffice to move the private person P.I. into the public arena.Both the applicant company and P.I. appealed against that judgment. On 15 April 2009 the Vienna Court of Appeal (Oberlandesgericht Wien) partly followed P.I.\u2019s appeal and declared that P.I. had additionally also been compromised in his most intimate personal sphere by the statement that he was \u201cthe new man at A.K.\u2019s side, did however not want to pose with his new love\u201d. The applicant company was sentenced to pay compensation in the amount of 600 Euro and to publish the operative part of the judgment. It further bore the costs of the appeal proceedings.The Court of Appeal reiterated domestic jurisprudence stating that \u201cintimate personal sphere\u201d not only encompassed events and situations in the confinement of a home, but also in a \u201cprivate area within a public space\u201d (\u201cPrivat\u00f6ffentlichkeit\u201d) that meant private actions in public space that nevertheless was not open for just anyone. When the applicant company thus complained that A.K. and P.I. had appeared in public before the charity dinner, the court referred to the concept of \u201cprivate area within a public space\u201d. Furthermore, the mere fact that the relationship had been witnessed in public before could not as such determine whether a certain report was capable of compromising P.I., or not. The allegation of an extramarital affair must be considered to compromise the intimate sphere within the meaning of section 7 of the Media Act, as must the statement on pending divorce proceedings and in this context the information on a \u201cnew partner\u201d and a \u201cnew love\u201d. The Court of Appeal reiterated that pending divorce proceedings had not the same finality as a divorce, since a couple could still decide to discontinue the divorce proceedings. However, according to the jurisprudence, the intention to divorce was part of a person\u2019s intimate sphere. In response to the applicant company\u2019s argument that P.I. himself had demonstrated the end of his marriage in public by appearing together with A.K., the Court of Appeal found that such appearances were not comparable to those of public figures within the context of their political work or state functions, but needed to be seen as belonging to that already mentioned \u201cprivate area within a public space\u201d. Those appearances had had no official character and did not allow the conclusion that P.I. had opened up his private life to the public arena. Nor could they be understood as consent to broad media reporting \u2013 not only on the couple attending a charity dinner, but also on them conducting an extramarital affair, being partners and in love, all the while divorce proceedings in respect to P.I. were still pending.With regard to the applicant company\u2019s argument that reporting on P.I. as being the minister\u2019s new partner was inseparable from reporting on the minister herself, the Court of Appeal observed that all the while media were allowed to report on the Minister of Health, Families and Youth\u2019s conduct, considering that she was nominated by the People\u2019s Party that represented a conservative image on families, and that her credibility was at stake and of public interest, that did not automatically justify that media could violate her partner\u2019s private sphere. Indeed, P.I. himself was not a public figure. It would have sufficed, to satisfy the justified public interest in the minister\u2019s conduct, to report that she maintained an obviously sexual relationship with a married man. However, it had not been necessary to state who that married man was. The report in question exceeded the necessary information and also included details on P.I.\u2019s marriage.Since it was unlawful to deal with the single statements in the report separately, the Court of Appeal set aside the dismissal of the first instance court of the statement that P.I. was the \u201cnew man at A.K.\u2019s side and refused to pose with his new love\u201d.That judgment was served on the applicant company\u2019s counsel on 4 May 2009.B. Relevant domestic lawSection 7 of the Media Act, which has the title \u201cInterference with a person\u2019s most intimate personal sphere\u201d (Verletzung des h\u00f6chstpers\u00f6nlichen Lebensbereiches), reads as follows:\u201c(1) If a person\u2019s strictly private life is discussed or presented in the media in a manner which is apt to compromise this person in public, the person concerned may claim compensation from the owner of the media for the injury suffered.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone.

The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.The applicant is a Jehovah\u2019s Witness.On 7 March 2013 the applicant and a co-religionist, N.S., were carrying out door-to-door visits in the town of Nosivka, distributing printed invitation cards for a special religious service. The visits constituted a part of their religious practice.At about 1 p.m. they visited the house of V.S., a fifty-year-old man they were unacquainted with. He met them at the front gate of the house. According to the applicant, V.S. noticed the invitations and immediately identified the women as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses; he started to shout invectives at them calling them \u201cshtundists\u201d and \u201cwhores\u201d; then he punched the applicant in the head causing her to stagger. The applicant and N.S. moved away as V.S. threatened to unleash his dog.On 8 March 2013 the applicant\u2019s health deteriorated: she had dizziness and nausea.On 9 March 2013 she was admitted to the neurological department of the Nosivka District Central Hospital for inpatient treatment. She was diagnosed with concussion. A bruise on the face was also noted.On the same day the applicant complained to the Nosivka District Police Department. The police opened a criminal investigation.The police decided to question V.S. concerning the incident with the two women. V.S. submitted that the two women had offered him literature and evangelised for the Jehovah Witnesses\u2019 beliefs. He had demanded that they leave. At a certain point, as the women would not leave, he had slapped one woman on the face.During the investigation the applicant insisted that the police should investigate the case under Article 161 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. She claimed that V.S. had known that she had been a Jehovah\u2019s Witness and that he had ill-treated her on those grounds. N.S. was questioned by the police and confirmed the applicant\u2019s statements.On 14 May 2013 the investigator informed V.S. that he was suspected of having committed a crime under Article 125 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. When questioned on that day, V.S. submitted that he could not remember if the women had been holding anything in their hands and what they had been talking about; he could, however, remember that they had invited him somewhere; despite his requests, the women would not leave, so he had then slapped one woman on the face. V.S denied any possible element of religious intolerance in his conduct.On 20 May 2013 V.S. additionally submitted to the investigator that he had slapped the applicant because she had humiliated him; he might have said obscenities but those words had not been addressed to the applicant and her companion. V.S. denied the incident had any religious connotations.Within the criminal case the applicant submitted a civil claim in respect of damage caused by V.S.During the trial the applicant insisted that she had been ill-treated on the grounds of her religion and requested that the case be classified under Article 161 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code.On 16 July 2013 the Nosivka District Court found V.S. guilty of intentional infliction of a minor physical injury under Article 125 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code and punished him with a fine of 850 Ukrainian hryvnias (UAH). The court found that V.S. had inflicted minor physical injuries on the applicant following of a sudden bout of anger; no aggravating circumstances could be established. In its judgment the court relied on the statements of V.S., N.S. and the applicant as well as on medical and other documentary evidence.As to the civil claims, the court noted that V.S. had paid the claim in respect of pecuniary damage; in respect of non-pecuniary damage, the court awarded the applicant UAH 3,000.The applicant appealed arguing that the investigating authorities and the trial court had failed to examine the issue of religious hatred which had underpinned the criminal conduct of the defendant, and that her freedom of religion had not been protected. They asserted that the case had to be classified under Article 161 \u00a7 2 of the Criminal Code. In addition they argued that the crime was committed on the grounds of religious enmity which was an aggravating circumstance under Article 67 of the Criminal Code.On 26 September 2013 the Chernihiv Regional Court of Appeal upheld the judgment of 16 July 2013. It dismissed the applicant\u2019s allegation that the crime had been committed on the grounds of her religion noting that no such motive had been established in the court proceedings.The applicant appealed on points of law, repeating her argument that the issue of religious intolerance had not been examined.On 8 January 2014 the Higher Specialised Civil and Criminal Court upheld the decisions of the lower courts considering that they had been lawful and substantiated.B.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only.

The relevant articles referred to information gathered in the course of the investigation against him and indicated that the applicant had committed the robbery. The investigation was eventually discontinued for lack of evidence.Although the Ohrid Court of First Instance granted, in part, the applicant\u2019s compensation claim against the Ministry of the Interior, finding that the police authorities had released the information to the press at the early stages of the investigation, the Bitola Court of Appeal overturned that judgment and dismissed the applicant\u2019s claim. It found that under the relevant domestic law the applicant was not entitled to claim compensation from the Ministry and that there was no evidence that the police had released the information to the press.

His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period.

It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease.

In the course of this operation, they were allegedly physically assaulted by the officers, who were kicking and hitting them, some using police batons.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

She is represented before the Court by Mr C. MacGeehin of MacGeehin Toale Solicitors, a lawyer practising in Dublin.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.1. The birth of the applicant\u2019s first childIn 1963 the applicant was pregnant with her first child. The expected delivery date was 7 September 1963.On 18 September 1963 the applicant was admitted to the Coombe Hospital in Dublin. She signed a form stating \u201cI give my consent for any operation or anaesthetic which may be necessary\u201d. She subsequently underwent an x-ray pelvimetry which showed that the sub-pubic arch was narrow; the transverse diameter, stated as \u201cnormally\u201d being 13.5 centimetres, was 10.8 centimetres; and, while the foetus was small, there was some cephalo-pelvic disproportion (disproportion between the size of the baby\u2019s head and the mother\u2019s pelvis); and the \u201coutlet was diminished\u201d.The applicant was examined under anaesthesia on 25 September 1963. During this examination, it was noted that \u201cthe head could not be made to engage in the pelvis. Symphysiotomy performed\u201d.A surgical symphysiotomy involves partially cutting through the fibres of the pubis symphysis (the joint uniting the pubic bones) so as to enlarge the capacity of the pelvis. The procedure allows the pubis symphysis to separate so as to facilitate natural childbirth where there is a mechanical problem. According to the applicant, at the time she did not know that the procedure carried out on 25 September 1963 was a symphysiotomy. However, she recalled feeling that she had been \u201csplit open\u201d or \u201csplit in half\u201d immediately following the procedure, and feeling unstable when walking.Twelve days later, on 7 October 1963, the applicant\u2019s daughter was delivered vaginally with the assistance of forceps. She claims that as she was still recovering from the symphysiotomy she was physically unable to look after her daughter and had to rely on friends and relatives for assistance. As a consequence, she was unable to bond with her.In the years that followed her daughter\u2019s birth, the applicant claimed that she suffered from back pain, hip pain, urinary incontinence and a number of psychological problems, all of which she attributed to the normal complications of childbirth.The applicant gave birth to a second child in December 1968.2. Controversy surrounding the use of symphysiotomies in IrelandSymphysiotomy was first introduced in the eighteenth century for selected cases of obstructed labour. Although its use continues to be indicated in certain specific situations, by the mid-twentieth century it had largely been abandoned in Western Europe, due, in large part, to the fact that caesarean sections had become much safer. In the 1940\u2019s, however, the practice was reintroduced in certain Irish maternity hospitals and it continued to be used there, to varying degrees, until the mid-1980s.Concerns regarding the prevalence of symphysiotomies in these maternity hospitals and the long-term effects of the procedure emerged in 2001. Many women who had undergone symphysiotomies reported chronic health problems which they attributed to the procedure. Moreover, there was believed to be a strong correlation between the use of the procedure and the acceptance of Catholic doctrine regarding sterilisation and contraception. In particular, it was suggested that symphysiotomies were favoured over caesarean sections because it was believed that in cases of mild to moderate disproportion a symphysiotomy would enable subsequent children to be delivered vaginally. A caesarean section, on the other hand, would not address the underlying problem and a fear of repeat sections might cause women to resort to contraception, which was illegal in Ireland until 1980.In the 2000s patient advocacy groups called for an independent inquiry into the use of symphysiotomies in Irish hospitals from the 1950s through to the mid-1980s. No review was carried out at this time. There were two attempts to commission reports to evaluate the practice, but in each case the reviewer(s) withdrew from the project, due either to concerns about partiality or to disagreements over the scope of the review.Following a meeting in late 2003 between the Minister for Health and a patient advocacy group, the Health Service Executive put in place a support system for women who had undergone symphysiotomies. This included the appointment of regional liaison officers to meet with the women to discuss their healthcare needs; the issuing of General Medical Service cards providing women with access to free healthcare, regardless of means; a refund of any medical expenses directly related to symphysiotomy; and the organisation of individual pathways of care, including gynaecological, urological and orthopaedic assessment, a home assessment by an occupational therapist or physiotherapist, the fast-tracking of applications for home help and home modifications, and the provision of physiotherapy, reflexology, acupuncture and counselling.On 18 February 2010 a television documentary (\u201cPrimetime\u201d) revealed that in the second half of the twentieth century some 1,500 women had symphysiotomies performed on them in Irish maternity hospitals. A second documentary about the use of symphysiotomies (\u201cTonight with Vincent Brown\u201d) aired in June 2011.In 2010 both the Medical Missionaries of Mary (who were responsible for the Hospital of Our Lady of Lourdes in Drogheda, one of the maternity hospitals in which the procedure was most frequently employed) and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland issued apologies to anyone who suffered hurt or complications as a result of a symphysiotomy. Representatives from the Institute have since met with some mothers and their families to talk through their experience of the procedure.In 2011 the Department of Health commissioned a report by Professor Oonagh Walsh, at the time a Senior Research Fellow in Medical History in the School of History at University College Cork (see section on \u201cRelevant public investigations into the use of symphysiotomy in Irish maternity hospitals\u201d below). According to the terms of reference, the purpose of the report was to document the rates of symphysiotomy and maternal mortality from 1944 to 1984 and, in particular: to assess symphysiotomy rates against maternal mortality rates during that period; critically appraise international reviews of symphysiotomy practice and associated rates in a number of comparable countries and in Ireland; review any guidelines and protocols that applied in Ireland on symphysiotomy over the time period; and write a report based on these findings, providing an accurate picture of the extent of the use of symphysiotomy in Ireland, and an examination of the Irish experience relative to other countries.On 29 November 2013 the Minister for Health appointed Judge Yvonne Murphy to conduct a non-statutory review with the aim of finding closure for women who had undergone a symphysiotomy procedure (see section on \u201cRelevant public investigations into the use of symphysiotomy in Irish maternity hospitals\u201d below). The terms of reference were to: examine all relevant reports and information relating to symphysiotomy; meet women who had undergone surgical symphysiotomy procedures to assess what, in their opinion, would bring closure for them; assess, in conjunction with the State Claims Agency and other relevant bodies, the relative liabilities of insures, indemnifiers, and/or other parties in relation to cases pending, or which might arise, as a result of surgical symphysiotomy procedures; and meet insures, indemnifiers and/or other parties to explore and negotiate a quantum representing a fair contribution towards the fund in order to establish an ex-gratia scheme to put closure on the issue for the women involved.In July 2014 the Minister for Health announced the establishment of an ex-gratia payment scheme offering compensation to women who had undergone a surgical symphysiotomy or pubiotomy in any hospital in Ireland between 1940 and 1990 (see section on \u201cThe ex-gratia payment scheme\u201d below).3. Kearney v McQuillan and North Eastern Health BoardA symphysiotomy was performed on Mrs Kearney in 1969, immediately after her first child was born by caesarean section (an \u201con the way out\u201d symphysiotomy). She was eighteen years old at the time. In 2004 she brought a claim for medical negligence against the hospital, arguing that the procedure had been carried out without her knowledge or express consent and she had been left with a legacy of problems which had a significant adverse effect on many aspects of her life. She claimed that in the days and weeks after the procedure she had suffered profound pain; as she had been bandaged from her waist to her pelvic area, and could not get out of bed, she was unable to visit her new-born son for six days after his birth; and she had been unable to take care of him and bond with him following his discharge from hospital. In the longer term, she complained of continuous back pain, incontinence, and pain during sexual intercourse. Furthermore, she had been unable to face the prospect of further pregnancies and became depressed and anxious.The hospital argued that it was prejudiced due to the fact that many of the witnesses, including the consultant gynaecologist, were deceased or their whereabouts were unknown. The High Court found that the question of consent could only be determined having heard the evidence of those who were present when the plaintiff had given her written consent to the caesarean section. Moreover, having regard to the principles in Dunne (an infant) v. National Maternity Hospital (see section on \u201cRelevant domestic law and practice\u201d below), it would be necessary to debate the appropriateness of the procedure in the plaintiff\u2019s case, and that could only be done in light of the actual testimony of the person who carried it out. The High Court therefore struck out the claim on the basis that the hospital would be severely prejudiced on account of the delay, and that there was a real and serious risk of an unfair trial.On appeal, Mrs Kearney reformulated her claim and contended that the principal issue was that there had been no justification whatsoever for the performance of a symphysiotomy following delivery by caesarean section.In a judgment of 26 March 2010, the Supreme Court held that the reformulation of the claim removed any prejudice to the defendant in defending the claim as it removed any complaint about the manner in which the symphysiotomy was carried out (as opposed to the decision to carry it out at all) and it rendered irrelevant the matter of any missing contemporary records. As a consequence, the claim could be defeated by the defendant if it could establish any circumstances prevailing in 1969 which would have justified carrying out a symphysiotomy and/or by establishing by means of credible evidence some realistic reason for the carrying out of the procedure in the circumstances of the case.The High Court subsequently found that there could be no justification whatsoever for the use of the procedure in the plaintiff\u2019s case as her baby had already been delivered when the symphysiotomy was performed. Moreover, there was no evidence of disproportion between the size of the baby\u2019s head and the plaintiff\u2019s pelvis. The caesarean section had been performed because there was a failure in the pregnancy to progress and there were difficulties in the presentation of the baby\u2019s head; however, unlike disproportion, the evidence established that such a presentation was a \u201cphenomenon of first labour\u201d which would be rare in a subsequent pregnancy. On this basis, the obstetrician could not have diagnosed any need for future caesarean operations or inferred that a future pregnancy would not go to full normal delivery. The court awarded the plaintiff EUR 450,000.The defendant appealed to the Supreme Court, which delivered its judgment on 11 July 2012. It upheld the High Court\u2019s findings on liability, but reduced the award of damages to EUR 325,000. While it accepted Mrs Kearney\u2019s truthfulness and credibility as a witness, the court noted that she had, despite her medical problems, carried on a relatively normal life and worked for a period of some twenty-five years. Therefore, without underestimating the very serious nature of her injuries, it considered that they fell short of the highest category described.4. The applicant\u2019s claim for damagesAccording to the applicant, she became aware that she might have undergone a symphysiotomy when a friend telephoned her after watching a television programme about the procedure. On 20 February 2010 she wrote to the Coombe Hospital to request copies of her medical records. It would appear that she did not provide sufficient information to enable the records to be found because on 23 April 2010 the hospital wrote to her, seeking further details such as her date of birth and her address at the time of her confinement. She did not reply to this letter, but made a further request in July 2011. She received copies of her medical records in August 2011.(a) Proceedings before the High CourtThe applicant issued a personal injuries summons against the Coombe Hospital on 6 September 2012. She initially claimed damages for personal injury flowing from the management of her labour and/or for the failure to obtain her lawful or proper consent for all procedures carried out in that regard. The defendant hospital raised a plea that the claim was statute barred as it had been issued after the expiry of the two-year time-limit; or, in the alternative, that it should be dismissed by reason of \u201cinordinate and inexcusable delay\u201d, as a result of which it was \u201cextremely prejudiced\u201d in its ability to defend the action and there was accordingly a real and serous risk it could not be afforded a fair trial.In an effort to avoid the risk that the claim might be struck out, the applicant agreed that it would proceed on one issue only: that there had been no justification whatsoever, in any circumstances, for the performance of an antenatal symphysiotomy in her case.The judgment of the High Court was delivered on 1 May 2015 following a fifteen-day hearing. At the outset, the judge found that, following the reformulation of the applicant\u2019s claim, it would be possible for the defendant to have a fair trial.In deciding whether the claim was statute barred, the judge observed that a number of the applicant\u2019s hospital notes in the years following the birth of her first child referred to the fact of symphysiotomy by name. Nevertheless, he accepted that she had heard that term for the first time when her friend telephoned her after watching a documentary on television. Although television programmes dealing with symphysiotomy had aired on 18 February 2010 and June 2011, he found that, as a matter of probability, the applicant had been contacted by her friend on 18 February 2010, because she had made the first request for her hospital records two days later. He considered, however, that her \u201cdate of knowledge\u201d was August 2011, being the date on which she had received her hospital records. Accordingly, he found that the claim had been issued within the two-year statutory time-limit and the hospital\u2019s plea under the statute of limitations had to fail.Although the applicant\u2019s General Practitioner records only dated back to 1995, the judge accepted that she had suffered from physical and psychological trauma as a result of the symphysiotomy. In particular, he accepted her evidence of a lifetime of some physical instability and incontinence which was at least exacerbated by the symphysiotomy. He further accepted that she was traumatised by her experience, that she suffered distress and anxiety afterwards and that she was very fearful of becoming pregnant again. The judge noted that while \u201cit would be easy to be cynical and associate these complaints with a retrospective belief fostered by associating with the \u2018survivors of symphysiotomy\u2019\u201d, the applicant had raised these matters with work colleagues long before legal proceedings were contemplated. That being said, the judge also noted that the applicant had been in regular and constant employment since returning to work in 1964 and, notwithstanding her age, she was still working as a waitress at the time of the hearing.Turning to the central question in the case (namely, whether there had been no justification whatsoever, in any circumstances, for the performance of an antenatal symphysiotomy), the judge had no doubt that the procedure would not have been carried out either at the start of the reintroduction of symphysiotomy into Dublin or after the introduction of \u201cactive management of labour\u201d in the mid-to-late 1960s. However, while he acknowledged that prophylactic symphysiotomy was somewhat controversial in 1963, he accepted that in the Dublin maternity hospitals at that time a trial of labour was not always required for a consultant to conclude that a vaginal delivery would not be possible and in those cases a prophylactic symphysiotomy without trial of labour was a reasonable though limited option. In the present case the pelvimetry and the examination under anaesthetic had convinced the treating doctors that a vaginal delivery would not be possible. This view was supported by the defendant\u2019s medical experts, who stated \u2013 and the applicant did not dispute \u2013 that it was \u201c90% certain\u201d that had she been afforded a trial of labour she would not have been able to deliver without surgical intervention in the form of either a symphysiotomy or caesarean section. Consequently, the judge accepted that the treating doctors had proceeded on a course which they believed was not adverse to the applicant and was safer for her child. He further concluded that given the real fear of multiple caesarean sections, the belief that symphysiotomy was a relatively benign procedure with little by way of adverse sequelae for the mother, and the wide acceptance of symphysiotomy among the leading consultants in the Coombe and National Maternity Hospital, the applicant had not established that the practice had such \u201cinherent defects\u201d that ought to have been obvious to any person giving the matter due consideration. Consequently, he was not satisfied that a symphysiotomy could not have been justified in the applicant\u2019s case.(b) The Court of AppealThe applicant appealed against the rejection of her claim for damages and the defendant hospital cross-appealed against the judge\u2019s finding that the claim was not statute-barred.On 14 October 2016 the Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal as it was fully satisfied that there was credible evidence to support the judge\u2019s finding that, by the standards which prevailed in 1963, the prophylactic symphysiotomy performed on her could have been clinically justified. Moreover, the Court of Appeal found that the judge had been entitled, on the evidence before him, to conclude that prophylactic symphysiotomy was a general and approved practice in a relatively rare group of cases where clinical findings made in advance of labour strongly suggested that the mother could not deliver vaginally without operative intervention, but was likely to deliver vaginally following symphysiotomy. Regarding the question of whether the practice had \u201cinherent defects\u201d, while the court expressed reservations about the judge\u2019s reasoning, it agreed that the applicant had not discharged the \u201cheavy onus\u201d required to succeed on this ground.In dismissing the applicant\u2019s appeal, the Court of Appeal sought to explain why the applicant had failed in her claim while the plaintiff in Kearney had succeeded. It observed:\u201cThe fact that the plaintiff in this action failed in her claim relating to a symphysiotomy performed on her in 1963 does not necessarily mean that a court considering the circumstances in which another symphysiotomy procedure was performed on a different patient might not come to a different conclusion....In Kearney, the baby had been delivered before the symphysiotomy was carried out. Accordingly, the procedure was not performed to protect the mother and baby from the risks involved in an obstructed labour. In [L.F.\u2019s] case, where the procedure was carried out prior to the onset of labour, all of the clinical indications suggested that she was likely to have an obstructed labour. Dr [B] and Professor [B] said it was 90% likely that she could not have delivered without a caesarean section or a symphysiotomy.In Kearney, the High Court found no evidence of any obstruction or pelvic deformity likely to cause the patient difficulty in the course of any future delivery. Thus, there could never have been any justification for carrying out a procedure which had the consequential benefit of making the pelvis a little more accommodating on future deliveries ... In [L.F.\u2019s] case the position was entirely different. X-ray pelvimetry and examination under general anaesthetic provided objective evidence which strongly suggested that [L.F.] was suffering from mild to moderate CPD. Further, her pelvis was not normal. It was anthropoid in presentation and she also had signs of outlet contraction.The evidence clearly established that [L.F.\u2019s] symphysiotomy was performed to avoid an obstructed labour and to allow her to deliver vaginally thus facilitating her avoidance of all of the risks that she might otherwise be exposed to in the course of one and probably several more caesarean sections in the course of her lifetime. No such considerations arose in Mrs Kearney\u2019s case.Thus, unlike in Kearney where the procedure was carried out in the absence of any clinical indications that might justify its performance, in [L.F.\u2019s] case the symphysiotomy was performed for a range of clinical reasons which at the time were generally approved of by those at the very top of the obstetric profession in this country.\u201dThe Court of Appeal allowed the hospital\u2019s cross-appeal. The court found that the applicant\u2019s date of knowledge was 18 February 2010 and not August 2011, as this was the date on which she had sufficient knowledge to connect her injuries to the procedure which she knew had been carried out on her in 1963. As a consequence, the applicant\u2019s claim was also dismissed on the ground that the statutory limitation period had passed by the date of commencement of the proceedings.The costs of the appeal were awarded to the defendant hospital to be taxed in default of agreement.(c) The Supreme CourtThe applicant sought permission to appeal to the Supreme Court, challenging the High Court\u2019s assessment of the concepts of a \u201cgeneral and approved practice\u201d and \u201cinherent defects\u201d, where the burden of proof lies in medical negligence cases, and how the date of knowledge is assessed with regard to the statute of limitations. The Supreme Court refused the application for leave to appeal on 17 February 2017. It noted, in particular, that:\u201cThere can be no doubt that the practice of symphysiotomy, in general, has attracted much attention in the relatively recent past, including media scrutiny, public discussion and debate in the Dail, as well as an examination by the United Nations Human Rights Committee, with many suggesting that an independent inquiry is required so as to provide an effective remedy for those women who have or who intend to pursue this issue legally. As important as this debate might be, however persuasive the argument may present, such is not the gateway to a further appeal to this Court.\u201d5. The ex-gratia payment schemeThe applicant did not apply to the ex-gratia payment scheme for an award because she believed that there was no possibility of any acknowledgement of a breach of her rights; the quantity of the awards did not reflect the gravity of the harm inflicted on her; and the application window was unreasonably short.B. Relevant domestic law and practice1. Actions in tortA tort is a civil wrong which causes someone to suffer loss resulting in legal liability for the person who commits the tortious act. The tort of negligence requires proof that there was a duty of care between the plaintiff and the defendant (which involves establishing the existence of a relationship of proximity between the parties such as would call for the exercise of care by one party towards the other), that that duty was breached and that that breach was causative of damage (see, for example, Beatty v. The Rent Tribunal [2005] IESC 66).In Dunne (an infant) v. National Maternity Hospital [1989] I.R. 91 the principles applicable to medical negligence actions were set out as follows:\u201c1. The true test for establishing negligence in diagnosis or treatment on the part of a medical practitioner is whether he has been proved to be guilty of such failure as no medical practitioner of equal specialist or general status and skill would be guilty of if acting with ordinary care.2. If the allegation of negligence against a medical practitioner is based on proof that he deviated from a general and approved practice, that will not establish negligence unless it is also proved that the course he did take was one which no medical practitioner of like specialisation and skill would have followed had he been taking the ordinary care required from a person of his qualifications.3. If a medical practitioner charged with negligence defends his conduct by establishing that he followed a practice which was general, and which was approved of by his colleagues of similar specialisation and skill, he cannot escape liability if in reply the plaintiff establishes that such practice has inherent defects which ought to be obvious to any person giving the matter due consideration.4. An honest difference of opinion between doctors as to which is the better of two ways of treating a patient does not provide any ground for leaving a question to the jury as to whether a person who has followed one course rather than the other has been negligent.5. It is not for a jury (or for a judge) to decide which of two alternative courses of treatment is in their (or his) opinion preferable, but their (or his) function is merely to decide whether the course of treatment followed, on the evidence, complied with the careful conduct of a medical practitioner of like specialisation and skill to that professed by the defendant...\u201dSection 3(1) of The Statute of Limitations (Amendment) Act 1991, as amended by section 7 of the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004, introduced a limitation period of two years from the date on which the cause of action accrued or the date of knowledge (if later) for actions for damages in respect of personal injuries caused by negligence, nuisance or breach of duty.2. Actions for breach of constitutional rights (constitutional tort actions)In Meskell v. CIE [1973] IR 121, the Supreme Court stated:\u201c... if a person has suffered damage by virtue of a breach of a constitutional right or the infringement of a constitutional right that person is entitled to seek redress against the person or persons who have infringed that right.\u201dIn Ireland, there is an unenumerated constitutional right to bodily integrity.The limitation period for bringing an action for damages for breach of constitutional rights is six years (McDonnell v. Ireland [1998] 1 IR134).3. The European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003Section 3 of the 2003 Act provides as follows:\u201c(1) Subject to any statutory provision (other than this Act) or rule of law, every organ of the State shall perform its functions in a manner compatible with the State\u2019s obligations under the Convention provisions.(2) A person who has suffered injury, loss or damage as a result of a contravention of subsection (1), may, if no other remedy in damages is available, institute proceedings to recover damages in respect of the contravention in the High Court (or, subject to subsection (3), in the Circuit Court) and the Court may award to the person such damages (if any) as it considers appropriate.\u201d4. The interrelationship between tort law, the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003Resort to constitutionally created torts and the 2003 Act only occurs if there is a gap in existing tort law which needs to be supplemented. In DF v Garda Commissioner (no 3) [2014] IEHC 2013 (App. 10) the applicant had brought actions in tort for assault and false imprisonment; constitutional claims; claims under the 2003 Act; claims under the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union; and claims under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities 2006. The defendants contended that some of these claims should be struck as either unsustainable in their own right or as otherwise merely replicating claims for damages in respect of the nominate torts of assault and false imprisonment. In response, the High Court Judge indicated that\u201cif the claims simply duplicate or cannot add anything to the well-established nominate torts of false imprisonment, assault and battery or if they present no justiciable issue, I propose to strike them out pursuant to the courts\u2019 inherent jurisdiction at this preliminary stage.\u201dThe judge accepted that a complaint of a breach of the constitutional right to liberty added nothing to the claim for false imprisonment, but considered it possible that the nominate torts of assault and battery would insufficiently vindicate the constitutional rights to the integrity of the person. However, in the circumstances of that case the claim based on Article 3 of the Convention was struck out as it was considered that it added nothing to the existing claims for damages for assault and battery as well as to those for breach of constitutional rights.C. Relevant public investigations into the use of symphysiotomy in Irish maternity hospitals1. The report by Professor Oonagh Walsh (\u201cthe Walsh report\u201d)The Walsh report was prepared in two phases. The first phase was an independent academic research report, compiled with reference to printed sources and analysis of medical reports and research. Once that was completed, the second phase involved interviews with individuals directly involved in symphysiotomies, such as mothers, practitioners and midwives.(a) Phase oneA draft of the first phase of the report was delivered in June 2012. It noted that while symphysiotomies might have been more prevalent in Ireland than in other countries during the relevant period, it was nevertheless a rare intervention in comparison to caesarean sections, which rose steadily during the same period. The suggested figure of 1,500 symphysiotomies between 1944 and 1992 translated to a rate of 0.05 percent of total births, or 60 per 100,000 births. In comparison, caesarean sections accounted for just under two percent of deliveries in 1944 and over four percent in 1984.The report acknowledged that Irish obstetrical practice was heavily influenced by, and constrained within, a religious framework which was widely accepted by doctors and laypeople alike. The revival of symphysiotomy \u2013 a procedure which appeared to offer the possibility of safe repeat deliveries \u2013 therefore had to be considered within a context in which multiple births were the norm, artificial contraception and sterilisation were illegal as well as \u201cethically unacceptable\u201d, and repeat caesarean sections were believed to carry great dangers. Indeed, the lack of options in the control of fertility was acknowledged to be one of the key factors behind a return to symphysiotomy in the 1940s.The 2012 report further noted that symphysiotomy was statistically a far safer procedure than caesarean section, with lower maternal and foetal mortality rates. At the relevant time the economic situation of many Irish families was \u201cdire\u201d and the Dublin hospitals in particular served areas of significant deprivation. Poor diet and nutrition was not only a common cause of contracted pelvis, but it resulted in many women presenting in labour with other complications that made them poor candidates for general anaesthetic. Moreover, up until the 1960s there were concerns about the safety of repeat caesarean sections. Irish obstetricians \u2013 like their Western-educated colleagues \u2013 were trained to the so-called \u201cthree caesar rule\u201d and believed in the saying \u201conce a caesar, always a caesar\u201d. In Britain, it was common to perform several sections and then advise the mother either to be sterilised or to use artificial contraception. This was not an option in Ireland.According to the report, the indications for symphysiotomy remained generally constant over the review period (being mild to moderate disproportion). From the outset, therefore, it was viewed as a means of coping with this very specific cohort, and was never proposed as an alternative to caesarean section. The fact that it was more prevalent in some hospitals than in others was due in large part to the fact that some obstetricians had greater faith in the procedure than others.The report considered that the use of symphysiotomy as a prophylactic procedure (either in advance of labour or even, in the case of the \u201con the way out\u201d symphysiotomy, in advance of a further pregnancy) was a deviation from good practice as the degree of disproportion could only be evaluated during labour, and a woman diagnosed with disproportion in one pregnancy might have a normal delivery in the next. In Professor Walsh\u2019s opinion, the non-emergency application of symphysiotomy, while the mother was under general anaesthetic, appeared \u201cindefensible\u201d. No scientifically credible research proposed prophylactic symphysiotomy or any equivalent to symphysiotomy \u201con the way out\u201d. Furthermore, while there were no clinical guidelines governing the use of symphysiotomy in Irish maternity hospitals at the time, the generally accepted policy appeared to be to first perform a trial of labour.With regard to the long-term effects of the procedure, Professor Walsh was in no doubt that some women had suffered adverse consequences, some of which may have been exacerbated by having more children. She noted, however, that it was difficult to assess the long-term problems resulting from symphysiotomies as many of these were similar if not identical to the long-term complications of multiple pregnancies.On the issue of consent, the report noted that during the period under review there were no guidelines in Britain or Ireland for obtaining consent to medical procedures and during the 1940s and 1950s implicit or explicit consent was not required for medical interventions. Indeed, the report described an \u201coverwhelming culture of deference that militated against patient engagement\u201d. Moreover, it would be impossible to determine from this historic distance whether patients were informed when a symphysiotomy was about to be performed or if they were made aware of potential long-term health risks. Given the hierarchical nature of medical practice in the 1950s and 1960s, however, Professor Walsh accepted that it was unlikely that patients were consulted to any significant degree.The report noted that the use of symphysiotomy had gone into increasing decline from the early 1960s due to improvements in maternal health, increasing use of repeat lower section caesarean sections, increasing use of drugs to shorten labour, and a growing realisation that pelvic disproportion had been over-diagnosed. The report did, however, give special consideration to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, where symphysiotomy persisted twenty years after it had largely ceased elsewhere. It found that this was specifically linked to the tenure of the founding obstetrician, who was obeyed by management and nursing staff \u201cwithout question\u201d. He created an ethos which was \u201cunswervingly Catholic\u201d and was a firm believer in carrying out symphysiotomies in the hope of avoiding caesarean section. According to the report, it was \u201cunacceptable\u201d that the procedure had persisted for so long at this hospital when alternative methods were available for dealing with difficult deliveries.(b) Phase 2Following her interviews with persons affected by symphysiotomy, Professor Walsh considered that by far the greatest sense of disquiet related to the lack of knowledge regarding the procedure. In particular, there was a strong and widely held feeling that an explanation why a symphysiotomy was being performed in their case would have substantially eased patients\u2019 subsequent adjustment to any resulting physical and psychological problems. Without exception, the most favourable outcomes had been recorded in those cases where either the symphysiotomy had been discussed with the obstetrician beforehand, or when women were told what the procedure was and why it had been used in their cases. By contrast, the women who reported the worst outcomes were those who had not been consulted in advance and were not informed after their deliveries that a symphysiotomy had been performed. Almost twenty percent of respondents had not been told that a symphysiotomy had been performed, and these new mothers could not understand why their recovery was so different from that of other women.Another important theme that came out of the interviews was the wide divergence in the standard of aftercare, which impacted significantly upon long-term health outcomes. Women who were adequately bound, given bed rest and pain relief, and allowed to become mobile gradually after delivery reported the best immediate and long-term outcomes. However, despite the fact that the importance of bed rest was commonly known in the 1950s, many respondents were told by nursing staff to get out of bed and walk within a day or so of delivery. Many were also discharged from hospital with no guidance or support to ensure proper healing. In Professor Walsh\u2019s view, instructing a newly delivered mother who had just undergone a symphysiotomy to walk without support was an \u201cincomprehensive failure in duty of care\u201d. Moreover, the resulting instability led to long-term side effects for some women, and even to the incorrect fusion of the pelvis, leaving them with chronic pain and locomotive problems.The most significant difficulties reported in the aftermath of the procedure were chromic pain, difficulty walking, and problems with continence. Many of these were the same as those experienced following a normal but difficult labour, a fact which prevented many women from asking the questions that might have revealed that they had had a symphysiotomy, and from seeking additional specialist care.The report also considered the impact of symphysiotomies on husbands and children. Many women noted that they had experienced difficulties bonding with their babies, which was exacerbated by the fact that they were often unable to nurse or hold them while they were recovering from the procedure. Husbands were also affected, having to play a role in childcare after deliveries and, for the most part, being ill-equipped to deal with the complications that their wives were experiencing. Symphysiotomies also had a serious impact on many couples\u2019 sexual relationship, for two principal reasons: first, sex was often painful because of pelvic instability; and secondly, there was a great fear of falling pregnant again.Finally, in respect of redress, the report recommended the establishment of an independent specialist needs assessment team to evaluate individual cases, advise on care requirements and determine suitable levels of compensation.2. The report by Judge Yvonne Murphy (\u201cthe Murphy report\u201d)In her report published in 2014, Judge Murphy acknowledged that although symphysiotomy had been \u201can exceptional and rare intervention in obstetric practice in Ireland\u201d, many women who had undergone the procedure did not have good experiences. She noted that more than 150 women had instituted proceedings in the High Court and significantly more cases could follow. Such proceedings were, however, fraught with difficulties for both plaintiffs and defendants. A large percentage of plaintiffs were between 75 and 91 years of age and their ability to pursue actions through the courts was limited. In addition, they might face significant difficulties in establishing liability.First of all, the issue of consent was problematic. If a court decided that a procedure was wholly unnecessary or inappropriate, the question of consent would be irrelevant, but if a symphysiotomy was clinically indicated and within acceptable medical standards at the time, the courts would then have to decide if there had been lawful consent to the procedure. In emergency situations it may not have been possible to obtain consent, and the central question would then be whether a caesarean section ought to have been performed instead of a symphysiotomy. In non-emergency cases consent should have been given. At the relevant time, however, the practice of obtaining consent would have differed from obstetrician to obstetrician and any discussions were unlikely to have been recorded. During the relevant time period it was not unusual for women to be unaccompanied during labour and with the passage of time, and the death of many of the obstetricians and nursing staff concerned, it would now be all but impossible to make any useful inquiry into the issue of consent. As the inability to counter allegations of a lack of consent would place the defendants at a significant disadvantage, they could therefore seek to have the proceedings struck out on the grounds that the defence was irreparably compromised.Secondly, there was the issue of causation. Even if the absence of consent could be established, the plaintiffs would also have to show that if they had been given the appropriate information, they would have decided against the procedure.The report also considered the problem defendant hospitals were facing regarding insurance. The passage of time had left many hospitals unable to identify the relevant insurers and, even if they could be traced, the limits of indemnity were in many cases very low as the anticipated value of claims was much lower then than it would be today. Many hospitals would therefore have to conduct litigation out of their own budget. If this were the case, it would subsequently be open to the hospitals to seek to recover the award from the State under the Clinical Indemnity Scheme. As a consequence, the report indicated that the State risked exposure to the burden of a large proportion of any damages and/or costs awarded to successful litigants. In addition, following O\u2019Keeffe v. Ireland [GC], no. 35810/09, ECHR 2014 (extracts) there was also a possibility that the State could be directly involved in litigation on the basis that it should have adopted a greater supervisory role over the maternity hospitals.According to the report, the potential cost to the State of litigation could be in the region of EUR 94,750,000. The report therefore recommended that the State implement an ex-gratia payment scheme, with the sum of EUR 50,000 being paid to women who could demonstrate that they had undergone a surgical symphysiotomy, rising to EUR 100,000 if they suffered from a more complex array of injuries; and EUR 100,000 being paid to women who had a surgical symphysiotomy \u201con the way out\u201d, rising to EUR 150,000 if they suffered from a more complex array of injuries. Some legal costs would also be covered. It was proposed that applicants would discontinue any legal proceedings before accepting an award. The estimated cost of such a scheme would be in the region of EUR 33,482,000.Finally, the report noted that apologies had already been given by the Medical Missionaries of Mary and the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland. The question of any further apology was a decision for the Government to take on the advice of the Attorney General.D. The ex-gratia payment scheme1. The operation of the schemeThe scheme was extensively advertised. The opening date for applications was 10 November 2014 and the closing date was 5 December 2014. A determination by the Independent Assessor of the amount of an award was final and not subject to appeal.There were four categories of payment:1A: award of EUR 50,000 for symphysiotomy1B: award of EUR 100,000 for symphysiotomy with significant disability1C: award of EUR 100,000 where the symphysiotomy was carried out in advance of labour or where there was a combined operation of caesarean section and symphysiotomy; if significant disability resulted from such a procedure, the award rose to EUR 150,000.P1 and P2: EUR 100,000 \u2013 EUR 150,000 for pubiotomy with or without significant disability.Where legal advice was sought in relation to the making of an application, certain costs would be payable. However, before accepting an award claimants had to discontinue any legal proceedings.The ex-gratia scheme was administered by Judge Maureen Harding Clark, who had been appointed by the Minister of Health as the Independent Assessor. She was tasked with making awards available to eligible applicants as expeditiously as possible.2. The report into the operation of the schemeJudge Harding Clark subsequently prepared an extensive report on the operation of the scheme which was published by the Minister for Health in November 2016.The report indicated that almost 600 women had applied to the scheme and nearly 400 had received awards, totalling more than EUR 30,000,000. The awards made included 216 payments of EUR 50,000 to women in category A, and 168 of EUR 100,000, mostly where significant disability resulted from the procedure. Fifteen women received the maximum of EUR 150,000 under the scheme, having been found to have suffered significant disability following an elective symphysiotomy carried out after childbirth, or to have received a pubiotomy. One hundred and eighty five applicants were unable to establish their claim, despite being assisted by the Independent Assessor.Twenty-seven applications submitted after the closing date underwent full investigation to establish whether a symphysiotomy could be established from the existing records and from medical examinations. Twelve were rejected on the basis that no qualifying procedure was established. The remaining fifteen applications were accepted.According to the report, each application had \u201creceived an individual, careful and fair assessment\u201d and once symphysiotomy or pubiotomy was established, a \u201ccompassionate and generous view\u201d had been applied to the assessment of each claim. All applications capable of being examined, including those received after the closing date, underwent full investigation to determine if symphysiotomy could be established from medical records or medical examinations. Although each application had been fully investigated, following the operation of the scheme Judge Harding Clark was \u201cconfident\u201d that symphysiotomy was almost invariably recorded on birth registers and in annual clinical reports.In respect of the 185 applicants who were unable to establish their claim, Judge Harding Clark expressed surprise that so many women mistakenly believed that they had undergone a symphysiotomy. In addition, she observed that a large number of applicants reported seeing or hearing a saw, or feeling as though they were being \u201csawn in half\u201d, even though symphysiotomy was never performed with a saw. She considered it possible, however, that a traumatic birth experience and exposure to other women\u2019s stories might have helped create a \u201cself-convincing confabulation of personal history\u201d.Judge Harding Clark\u2019s report also provided an in-depth overview of the long-term effects many women experienced following a symphysiotomy. Having assessed each of the 600 applications to the scheme, she concluded that no general pattern of immediate or developmental injury was seen. The evidence did not confirm that symphysiotomy inevitably led to lifelong pain or disability, or that symphysiotomy patients aged in a manner which was different to that of non-symphysiotomy women. The majority of applicants who underwent symphysiotomy made a good recovery and went on to have normal pregnancies and deliveries and to lead a full life. Indeed, in most cases radiology showed that the pubic joint had fully approximated and normalised and there were very few cases of pelvic instability and premature hip degeneration. These results were supported by international medical studies into the use of the symphysiotomy, which also found no evidence that it led to a lifetime of pain or disability if carried out correctly.That being said, a small number of applicants suffered from pelvic pain and a slightly larger group from urinary issues. She found that whether the conditions were associated with prolonged labour, the use of forceps, parity, age or the symphysiotomy procedure was not possible at this remove to determine. It was, however, noted that many symphysiotomy procedures were carried out after \u201cfailed forceps\u201d, and many of the applicants who could not establish that they had undergone either a symphysiotomy or pubiotomy nevertheless reported harrowing memories of long-term side effects, such as difficulty walking and taking care of their babies, incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse.Pain and/or discomfort over the pubic joint during sexual relations in the first twelve months post-symphysiotomy was a very common complaint, although the vast majority of applicants became pregnant again within a year of the symphysiotomy. Several claimed that the procedure caused cessation of all sexual relations and the end of their reproduction, and a small number claimed that their reluctance to engage in sexual intercourse had led to the breakdown of their marriages.In light of her findings, Judge Harding Clark considered that the premise of the scheme \u2013 namely the widespread assumption that symphysiotomy was a surgical procedure which, as a matter of near certainty, created lifelong suffering \u2013 was unsupported by evidence. In fact, she found herself lowering the criteria for what constituted significant disability in order to help women \u201cover the line\u201d. For the purposes of the scheme, significant disability was generally assumed where radiological findings disclosed joint abnormality or a continuing diastasis (abdominal separation) of fifteen millimetres or more.With regard to the issue of knowledge, Judge Harding Clark found it \u201cvery difficult to believe\u201d that any patient who had actually undergone a symphysiotomy would not have been told of the procedure. To be unaware that a symphysiotomy had been performed would have required \u201cresolute and conspirational silence\u201d on the part of nurses who removed catheters, bindings and incisions; from physiotherapists who encouraged patients to mobilise; and from the obstetrician who conducted the six-week check-up. It was also standard practice at the time for consultants to write to General Practitioners notifying them of patients\u2019 births.Finally, Judge Harding Clark considered whether the use of the procedure in certain Irish hospitals was \u201ca Catholic practice or an Irish phenomenon\u201d. Although some evidence could be found of religious motivation for reintroducing symphysiotomy into Irish obstetrics in the 1940s, very detailed and forensic examination of available contemporaneous medical records failed to find evidence of a religious as opposed to obstetric reason when a symphysiotomy was performed. Some of the maternity hospitals in which symphysiotomies were performed were non-Catholic institutions and therefore unlikely to have been motivated by Vatican dogma. While many hospitals operated a \u201cCatholic ethos\u201d, regardless of whether a particular obstetrician was a practicing Catholic, the reality for the patient was the same, since contraception was not legally available. The route taken in United Kingdom hospitals (of sterilisation following one or two repeat caesarean sections) was not an option.Judge Harding Clark provided the following context:\u201cIreland of the 1940s was a very different place to the modern, clean, prosperous and mainly secular European State it is today. In 1943 when the first symphysiotomy was performed, the war was raging, rationing was in operation, malnutrition was common and TB was a major disease and a significant cause of early death. Living conditions for the poor in the slums of Dublin, Limerick and Cork were appalling. 30% of mothers giving birth at the Coombe and the Rotunda suffered from iron deficiency anaemia. Blood supplies were extremely expensive. The almoners\u2019 reports in the Dublin hospitals show that many mothers required assistance in the provision of free meals for themselves and clothing for their babies. More than 200 maternity deaths occurred every year in Ireland and even more babies were stillborn or died shortly after birth. Antibiotics were only becoming freely available. Ultrasound and vacuum extraction did not exist. However, the most relevant feature of Irish society then was that the laws and Constitution fully reflected the then strong religious practices and the conservative outlook of the general population. The Constitution recognised the special position of the Roman Catholic Church. Being Irish and being Catholic were almost synonymous. The vast majority of the Catholic population accepted without question the strict application of Catholic teaching on birth control, marriage and sexuality. Few women occupied positions of power in the patriarchal society where most professions were male dominated, divorce was prohibited and married women were expected to stay at home and raise children. Shortly after the religious direction in a Papal Encyclical in 1930 that any form of birth control was a grave sin, the State introduced laws criminalising the sale or importation of any contraceptive. Ireland was a Catholic country where religion was happily embraced by the bulk of the population.\u201dE. Report by Nils Mui\u017enieks, Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe following his visit to Ireland from 22 to 25 November 2016The report included the following section on symphysiotomy:\u201c4.3 SYMPHYSIOTOMY184. It is estimated that 1,500 women underwent symphysiotomy in Ireland mostly between the 1940\u2019s and the 1980\u2019s. Symphysiotomy is a surgical procedure that involves sundering the mother\u2019s pelvis to enable difficult childbirth. This procedure was not performed in other European countries during the same time period, as caesarean section was the procedure generally used in cases of difficult births. Symphysiotomy is said to have various health consequences including in some cases life-long pain, disability and emotional trauma. There have been three reports commissioned by the government on this practice. On the basis of the first two reports, the government set up an ex-gratia redress scheme for the victims. The third report dealt with the operation of the scheme itself.185. During his visit, the Commissioner was informed of a number of concerns from civil society about the way the redress scheme works. The scheme admits no wrongdoing or liability on the part of the state and public authorities, any private hospitals or nursing homes, or any medical staff. The level of compensation offered is considered to be very low compared to the level of abuse endured. In addition victims had to accept a legal waiver by which they agree not to question the amount of the indemnity allocated and they had to abandon their right to take further legal action against any responsible individual or body in order to obtain a payment under the scheme. Lastly, the window of opportunity for applying for compensation was of 20 working days since the commencement date of the Scheme, which was 10 November 2014.186. The above mentioned report on the operation of the scheme (The \u201cClark Report\u201d), which was published during the Commissioner\u2019s visit, was subject to particularly strong criticism from human rights NGOs and other stakeholders. The Commissioner himself was particularly struck by the patronising tone and the kind of information provided in the report. The report does not give acknowledgement to women\u2019s suffering and seems to perpetuate some gender stereotypes against (elderly) women. This is all the more unfortunate as the aim of the report was in principle only to describe the operation of the compensation scheme. The Commissioner notes that the government has chosen to endorse this report without giving any credit to the wide criticism that it had generated among human rights stakeholders in Ireland.187. For survivors of symphysiotomy who seek to obtain an effective remedy through the courts, evidential barriers represent a serious obstacle, as noted by the IHREC. In one of the cases brought to courts, the High Court accepted that the claimant suffered from a range of physical and psychological difficulties caused or contributed to by the antenatal symphysiotomy which took place in 1963 but rejected her claim that it was done without any justification\u201dF. Reports of International bodies1. United Nations Human Rights Committee: Concluding observations on the fourth periodic report of IrelandThis report, dated 19 August 2014, provided, insofar as is relevant:\u201cSymphysiotomyThe Committee expresses concern that symphysiotomy, a childbirth operation which severs one of the main pelvic joints and unhinges the pelvis, was introduced into clinical practice and performed on approximately 1,500 girls and women in public and private hospitals between 1944 and 1987 without their free and informed consent. While noting the publication of a report by Oonagh Walsh in 2012, the review of the findings of the report by Judge Yvonne Murphy and the planned establishment of an ex gratia scheme for the survivors of symphysiotomy, the Committee expresses concern at the State party\u2019s failure to: (a) initiate a prompt, comprehensive and independent investigation into the practice of symphysiotomy; (b) identify, prosecute and punish, where still possible, the perpetrators for performing symphysiotomy without patient consent; and (c) provide effective remedies to survivors of symphysiotomy for the damage sustained as a result of these operations (arts. 2 and 7).The State party should initiate a prompt, independent and thorough investigation into cases of symphysiotomy, prosecute and punish the perpetrators, including medical personnel, and provide the survivors of symphysiotomy with an effective remedy for the damage sustained, including fair and adequate compensation and rehabilitation, on an individualized basis. It should facilitate access to judicial remedies by victims opting for the ex gratia scheme, including allowing them to challenge the sums offered to them under the scheme.\u201d2. Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women: Concluding observations on the combined sixth and seventh periodic reports of IrelandIn this report, dated 19 March 2017, the Committee made the following observations:\u201cAccess to justice14. The Committee notes the numerous recommendations on the unresolved issue of historical abuses of women and girls by other United Nations human rights mechanisms such as the Human Rights Committee (CCPR/C/IRL/CO/4), the Committee Against Torture (CAT/C/IRL/CO/1) and the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (E/C.12/IRL/CO/3). While noting the efforts by the State party to resolve the issue of historical abuses regarding ... the medical procedure of symphysiotomy, the Committee regrets that the State party has not implemented the aforementioned recommendations. The Committee regrets:...(b) That, notwithstanding the publication of the Walsh and Murphy reports and the establishment of an ex gratia scheme in 2014, no effort has been made to establish an independent investigation to identify, prosecute and punish the perpetrators who performed the medical procedure of symphysiotomy without the consent of women;...15. The Committee observes that the historical abuses in relation to ... the medical practice of symphysiotomy give rise to serious violations that have a continuing effect on the rights of victims/survivors of those violations.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Ms A.E., is a Bulgarian national, who was born in 2004 and lives in Kostinbrod. She is represented before the Court by Ms N. Dobreva, a lawyer practising in Sofia.The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.BackgroundThe applicant, who had been in conflict with her mother following the death of her father in 2018, had just turned fifteen when she started a relationship with a 23-year-old man, D.M. In March 2019 she moved in with D.M., in his house in a village, where he provided for her upkeep and where she kept some of her personal belongings. Allegedly, he beat her regularly.The beating on 8 September 2019After D.M. beat the applicant on 8 September 2019, she ran away from him on the same day and was subsequently examined in an emergency room and by a forensic doctor.Medical report on the applicant\u2019s injuriesThe forensic medical report of 9 September 2019 recorded hematomas on the applicant\u2019s body, as follows: on the left side of the forehead (measuring 3,5-2,5 cm), on the lower side of the left eyelid (measuring 2,5\u20110,8 cm), on the inner side of the left cheek (measuring 0,7-0,2 cm), on the lower left side of the jaw (measuring 2-1,5 cm), behind the left ear (measuring 2-0,6 cm), on the left side of the neck (two marks measuring respectively 1,7-0,3 cm and 5-0,4 cm, and located at about 1 cm distance from one another), on the right side of the neck (measuring 1,5-0,3 cm), on the left armpit (two marks measuring respectively 2 cm-1cm and 1,5-1 cm), on the left upper arm (measuring 2,5-1,5 cm), on the back side of the right shoulder (measuring 4-2 cm) and on the inner side of the right thigh (measuring 5-5 cm).In addition, the report recorded a bruise, measuring 2,5-0,2 cm, on the front side of the right lower leg, as well as that the bruise was covered with a reddish-brown scab.The report contained a conclusion that the traumatic injuries had been caused by blows and pressure applied with or over hard, blunt and edgy objects. The report stated that the injuries could have been caused in the manner and at the time as described, and had caused the applicant pain and suffering.Notice of the beating to the prosecutionOn 27 September 2019, the director of the local Directorate for social assistance (\u201cthe director\u201d) communicated to the prosecution a notice about a crime having been committed against a minor and requested that pre-trial criminal proceedings be opened into it. In particular, the director described in writing several beatings of the applicant by D.M., which had reportedly taken place in the preceding months.During one of the beatings, on 8 September 2019, D.M. had slapped the applicant on the face, applied pressure to her neck in a choking position, pushed her to the ground, hit her head on the floor, and kicked her while she was on the ground. The applicant had felt pain in the head, jaw, chest and abdominal area, and had been seriously frightened.The communication specified that the applicant had been a victim of several offences, allegedly perpetrated by D.M.: in the first place, attempted murder under Article 115 in conjunction with Article 18 of the Criminal Code (\u201cthe CC\u201d), given that the marks on her neck indicated that pressure had been applied to her carotid artery. Such an act, according to the communication, generally leads to life-threatening consequences as it stops the blood-flow to the brain and causes a loss of conscience and death within a few seconds. Furthermore, the same act represented also light bodily harm under Article 130 of the CC, defined by the forensic doctor as \u201cpain and suffering\u201d and subsumed under the heavier offence under Article 115 of the CC.In addition, the aggression of the applicant represented ill-treatment of a minor under Article 187 of the CC, as she lived with D.M. and was under his care. Independently from the beating of 8 September 2019, D.M. was guilty of unlawfully living with a minor, as husband and wife, without the two being married, an offence under Article 191 of the CC.All of the above represented \u201csufficient data pointing to a crime having been committed\u201d within the meaning of Article 211 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (\u201cthe CCP\u201d). The communication specifically asked the prosecutor to investigate the light bodily harm the applicant had suffered, a privately prosecutable offence, as a publicly prosecutable offence instead, on the basis of a prerogative which the prosecutor had under Article 49 of the CCP. Also, it suggested that the prosecution question the applicant\u2019s mother, as well as the alleged aggressor\u2019s own sister and former girlfriend who could testify about his character.Follow-up by the prosecutionThe Kostinbrod District Prosecutor ordered a preliminary check which was carried out by the police.On 8 October 2019 the applicant was accommodated in a crisis centre for children who are victims of violence or trafficking.On the same day she stated to a police officer, who was interviewing her in the context of the preliminary check, that she wished to withdraw her statement as she was no longer troubled by D.M. When interviewed in turn, D.M. denied that he had beaten the applicant; the police officer issued him with a warning, and informed him about criminal responsibility in the case of inflicting medium and heavy bodily harm.On 19 November 2019 the Kostinbrod District Prosecutor refused to open criminal proceedings. The prosecutor found that only a privately prosecutable offence, namely light bodily harm, had been committed and the conditions under Article 49 of the CCP were not met.Appeals by the applicantThe applicant, assisted by a lawyer, challenged that refusal before the higher prosecution instances. She argued in particular that she had presented evidence of violence committed in respect of her, and evidence which corresponded to three publicly prosecutable offences. She also emphasised the gravity of those offences in the context of her age and gender. She relied on Article 3 of the Convention and on related case-law of the Court.The Sofia Regional Prosecutor confirmed the refusal on 6 February 2020. The prosecutor found that the bodily harm caused to the applicant had not been serious enough to warrant the opening of criminal proceedings for attempted murder, for the following reasons. Not every pressing on someone else\u2019s throat could be qualified as attempted murder; there was no evidence that the applicant and her boyfriend lived as husband and wife as she had refused a gynaecological examination; and the applicant was not in the care of her boyfriend, so it was unnecessary to discuss whether her beating fell under Article 187 of the CC.The applicant appealed further. She pointed out that her beating qualified as ill-treatment under Article 3 of the Convention and under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, hence it had to be investigated before a conclusion could be reached. On 10 April 2020 the Sofia Appellate Prosecutor upheld the lower prosecutor\u2019s decision, finding its conclusions correct.The applicant appealed before the Supreme Cassation Prosecution Office, arguing that under the Convention the authorities had a positive obligation to investigate complaints of domestic violence and referred to the related case-law of the Court. She pointed out that relevant evidence had not been collected. She also stated that a private criminal prosecution could not provide appropriate redress and was not an effective remedy for her as a minor. Given her complaints about having been a victim of several publicly prosecutable offences, she did not have to pursue a private prosecution for only one of them.On 4 August 2020, the Supreme Cassation Prosecution Office informed the applicant that there were no reasons for overturning the refusal to investigate her complaints.Relevant domestic lawUnder Article 161, in conjunction with Article 130, of the CC criminal proceedings in respect of wilfully inflicted \u201clight bodily harm\u201d may only be instituted by the victim directly in court and are not pursued by the public prosecutor. Under the CCP, where criminal proceedings are instituted by the victim, he or she acts as private prosecutor. The proceedings are discontinued if the victim fails to appear when summoned or abandons the case.Article 49 of the CCP allows the prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings on his/her own motion in respect of privately prosecutable offences, where the victim is not able to defend his/her rights and there is a legitimate interest due to a helpless status or dependence on the perpetrator of the crime.Article 93 of the CC specifies the meaning of \u201cdomestic violence\u201d as follows: \u201cThe offence has been committed in the context of \u2018domestic violence\u2019 if it has been preceded by: systematic physical, sexual or psychological abuse; placing the person in economic dependency; forcefully limiting their private life, personal freedoms and rights; and has been committed in respect of an ascending or descending relative, a current or former spouse, a person with whom one has a child, a person with whom one is living or has lived as husband and wife, or a person with whom one lives or lived in the same household\u201d. Domestic violence is not, as such, a specific offence in the CC; it is an aggravating circumstance in respect of a number of other offences under the CC, such as murder (Article 115-116 of the CC), kidnapping (Article 142 of the CC), deprivation of liberty (Article 142a of the CC) and coercion (Article 143 of the CC).As regards bodily harm, since February 2019, domestic violence is an aggravating circumstance in respect of each type of bodily harm sustained (light, medium or grave). Light bodily harm remains a privately prosecutable offence even when committed in the context of domestic violence.Relevant international materialsThe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (\u201cCEDAW Convention\u201d) was adopted in 1979 by the United Nations General Assembly and Bulgaria ratified it in 1982. The implementation of the CEDAW Convention is monitored by the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (\u201cthe CEDAW Committee\u201d), which makes general recommendations to the States parties on any specific matters concerning the elimination of discrimination against women.On 26 July 2017 the CEDAW Committee updated its General Recommendation no. 19 by adopting General Recommendation no. 35 on gender-based violence against women (CEDAW/C/GC/35). As regards prosecution and punishment, the CEDAW Committee recommended that States parties, amongst other things, (a) ensure effective access for victims to courts and tribunals and that the authorities adequately respond to all cases of gender-based violence against women, including by applying criminal law and, as appropriate, ex officio prosecution to bring alleged perpetrators to trial in a fair, impartial, timely and expeditious manner and imposing adequate penalties.In their Recommendation Rec(2002)5 on the protection of women against violence the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe recommended, amongst others, that member States \u201chave an obligation to exercise due diligence to prevent, investigate and punish acts of violence, whether those acts are perpetrated by the state or private persons, and provide protection to victims\u201d. The Recommendation also stated that member States should ensure that all victims of violence are able to institute proceedings, make provisions to ensure that criminal proceedings can be initiated by the public prosecutor, encourage prosecutors to regard violence against women as an aggravating or decisive factor in deciding whether or not to prosecute in the public interest, ensure where necessary that measures are taken to protect victims effectively against threats and possible acts of revenge and take specific measures to ensure that children\u2019s rights are protected during proceedings.The Recommendation CM/Rec(2009)10 of the Committee of Ministers to member States on integrated national strategies for the protection of children from violence, adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on 18 November 2009, emphasises that \u201cchildren\u2019s fragility and vulnerability and their dependence on adults for the growth and development call for greater investment in the prevention of violence and protection of children on the part of families, society and the State\u201d.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complained under Article 3 of the Convention, taken separately and in conjunction with Articles 13 and 14, that the relevant legal framework was deficient in that light bodily harm was not a publicly prosecutable offence under Bulgarian criminal law. Invoking the same Convention provisions, she also complained that, in the specific context of her situation as a victim of domestic violence, a minor and a girl, the prosecution\u2019s refusal to investigate the allegations of violence against her was in breach of the authorities\u2019 procedural obligation..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

They are represented before the Court by Mr L. Majt\u00e9nyi, a lawyer practising in Budapest.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.Act no. CXLVII of 2010 defines combatting terrorism as one of the tasks of the police. Within the force, a specific Anti-Terrorism Task Force (\u201cTEK\u201d) was established as of 1 January 2011. Its competence is defined in section 7/E of Act no. XXXIV of 1994 on the Police, as amended by Act no. CCVII of 2011.Under this legislation, TEK\u2019s prerogatives in the field of secret intelligence gathering include secret house search and surveillance with recording, opening of letters and parcels, as well as checking and recording the contents of electronic or computerised communications, all this without the consent of the persons concerned.The authorisation process of these activities is dependent on the actual competence exercised by TEK, namely, whether it is within the framework of secret surveillance linked to the investigation of certain particular crimes enumerated in the law (section 7/E (2)) or to secret surveillance within the framework of intelligence gathering for national security (section 7/E (3)).Whereas the scenario under section 7/E (2) is as such subject to judicial authorisation, the one under section 7/E (3) is authorised by the Minister of Justice, in order to (i) prevent terrorist acts or in the interests of Hungary\u2019s national security or (ii) rescue Hungarian citizens from capture abroad in war zones or in the context of terrorist acts.\u201cSection 7/E (3) surveillance\u201d takes place under the rules of the National Security Act under the condition that the necessary intelligence cannot be obtained in any other way. Otherwise, the law does not contain any particular rules on the circumstances in which this measure can be ordered, as opposed to \u201csection 7/E (2) surveillance\u201d, which is conditional on the suspicion of certain serious crimes. The time-frame of \u201csection 7/E (3) surveillance\u201d is 90 days, which can be prolonged for another 90-day period by the Minister; however, the latter has no right to learn about the results of the ongoing surveillance when called on to decide on its prolongation. Once the surveillance is terminated, the law imposes no obligation on the authorities to destroy any irrelevant intelligence obtained.The applicants filed a constitutional complaint on 15 June 2012, arguing in essence that the sweeping prerogatives under section 7/E (3) infringed their constitutional right to privacy.On 18 November 2013 the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint on the merits. It held in essence that, in the context of national security, the external control of any surveillance authorised by the Minister was represented by Parliament\u2019s National Security Committee (which had the right to call the Minister to account both in general terms and in concrete cases) and by the Ombudsman, and that this scheme was sufficient to guarantee respect for the applicants\u2019 constitutional right to privacy.This decision was published in the Official Gazette on 22 November 2013.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Article 8 of the Convention that they can be potentially subjected to unjustified and disproportionately intrusive measures within the framework of \u201csection 7/E (3) surveillance\u201d, in particular for want of judicial control. In their view, the latter issue also represents a violation of their rights under Articles 6 and 13..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M.

This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006.

He is represented before the Court by Ms E. Volni, a lawyer practising in Budapest.An earlier case of the applicant (application no. 4966/05) was declared inadmissible by a Committee on 11 December 2007.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.On 19 March 2005, following the pronouncement of the divorce of the applicant and his wife, the Budapest Central District Court placed the couple\u2019s child \u2013 born on 3 February 2003 \u2013 with the mother. In its final judgment of 27 March 2007 the Supreme Court regulated the applicant\u2019s access rights in a way that he had access to his son 4 days every month and was entitled to spend one month of the summer holiday with him, including the possibility to take him to the USA. The mother was obliged to hand over the necessary travel documents for this purpose.In August 2007 the applicant complained to the Budapest XIIth District Guardianship Authority that his access granted in respect of August 2007 could not be exercised on the account of the mother\u2019s reluctance to co-operate. The Guardianship Authority established that the mother and son had not been available on 1 August 2007 as regulated in the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment. On 11 September 2007 the Authority warned the mother that she might be fined for her conduct. The applicant for his part initiated enforcement proceedings with no success.On 1 July 2008 the mother again failed to comply with the applicant\u2019s access right. On 23 July 2008 the then competent Budapest XIIIth District Guardianship Authority imposed a fine of 100,000 Hungarian forints (\u201cHUF\u201d) (approximately 360 euros (EUR)) on her, ordering the handover of the child to the applicant on 1 August 2008.The applicant requested the enforcement of the access regulations. On 28 July 2008 a bailiff ordered the mother to deliver the child\u2019s passport to the applicant within three days. Nonetheless, she did not comply with this decision but handed over the child\u2019s passport to an employee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. However, the Ministry did not transfer the passport to the applicant upon the bailiff\u2019s order but returned it to the mother on 15 October 2008. The applicant lodged a criminal complaint against the mother. Eventually, on 19 October 2010 the Budapest Public Prosecutor\u2019s Office discontinued the investigation, finding no appearance of a criminal offence.On 24 September 2009 the Authority established the mother\u2019s non-compliance with the access regulations in respect of 1 August 2008 and imposed a further fine of HUF 200,000 (EUR 720) for the overdue visit. The mother\u2019s request for a judicial review was rejected by the Budapest Regional Court on 23 July 2010.It appears that the applicant was otherwise able to have contact with his son in compliance with the Supreme Court\u2019s decision.Meanwhile, both the applicant and the mother initiated actions before the Buda Central District Court in February 2007, the applicant seeking, in particular, a change in custody and the court or escrow deposit of the child\u2019s passport. The mother requested a restriction on the applicant\u2019s access rights, removing his entitlement to take the child to the USA. On 11 December 2008, in the joined proceedings, the court rejected both actions. The decision was upheld by the Budapest Regional Court, acting as a second instance court, on 25 January 2010.The child\u2019s envisaged stay with his father, first scheduled for 1 July and then rescheduled for 1 August 2009, did not take place. On both occasions a police officer accompanied the applicant to the mother\u2019s flat, but his access right could not be enforced, since the mother had left with the child for an unknown place. The applicant initiated enforcement proceedings, following which a penalty in the sum of HUF 50,000 (EUR 180) was imposed on the mother.Meanwhile, the applicant initiated another action before the Pest Central District Court, again seeking a change of custody. In an interim measure of 15 June 2010, the court ruled that the applicant\u2019s access rights in respect of the 2010 summer holiday should be exercised in Hungary. In its judgment of 19 May 2011 the court dismissed the applicant\u2019s action. It limited his access rights to the effect that the child\u2019s summer holiday could take place in Hungary only, and this until the child\u2019s sixteenth birthday, explaining that the child was concerned about his father not bringing him back to Hungary. The court also regulated the exact days of every other month when the applicant was entitled to visit his son in Hungary in the coming years. On 29 November 2011 the Budapest Regional Court upheld the first-instance decision, rejecting the applicant\u2019s request to establish the bi-monthly days of visit in a flexible way.It appears that simultaneously the applicant initiated proceedings in the USA with a view to an international warrant being issued in order to retrieve his child.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complains that, for five years, the authorities have failed to enforce a legally binding court decision on his access rights. He further submits that the Pest Central District Court\u2019s decision of 19 May 2011 establishing the exact days of visits for the following years was too cumbersome for him and thus unfair. He moreover complains about the authorities\u2019 inaction concerning the enforcement of his access rights concerning summer holidays and about the fact that subsequently his visits became limited to the territory of Hungary. He relies on Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention, Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of Protocol No. 4 and Article 5 of Protocol No. 7..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The application concerns the establishment of paternity based on DNA testing methods which became available only many years after the issue had seemingly already been resolved. Specifically, by 1971 the applicant\u2019s purported biological father obtained a final court ruling to the effect that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant was indeed his son. The applicant who had been born in 1969, however, apparently only became aware of this judgment in 2012, following his \u201cfather\u2019s\u201d death, and shortly thereafter sought the reopening of the said civil proceeding in order to definitively establish paternity by means of DNA testing, a method which had become available in the meantime but required a court order. Ultimately, by 23 January 2014, regular courts at two instances and the Constitutional Court all ruled against the applicant, referring to a lack of procedural basis for the requested reopening..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Mr Henrikas Jankovskis, is a Lithuanian national who was born in 1961 and is currently detained in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows. The applicant is serving his sentence in Pravieni\u0161k\u0117s prison.Internet accessOn 30 May 2006 the applicant requested information from the Ministry of Education about the possibility of enrolling at university. He was subsequently informed that all relevant information was posted on an internet website. On 28 June 2006 the applicant addressed the prison authorities with a request for internet access. On 1 July 2006 the prison authorities informed the applicant that the rules in force did not extend to access to the internet for prisoners. On 2 February 2007, having reviewed the provisions regulating rules of detention the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court dismissed the complaint by the applicant. The court observed that although the prison rules did not explicitly prohibit the use of internet by the prisoners, the list of prohibited items included telephones and radio-communication. These limitations were designed to limit the prisoners\u2019 possibilities to commit new crimes. The court then concluded that prohibition of use of internet was also limiting such possibilities. The court also observed that the requirements set by the prison administration\u2019s order were mandatory for the applicant, as he was under an obligation to obey the prison order.On 11 December 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision. The court observed that no laws regulating prisoners\u2019 rights sanctioned the use of internet, and that the prison authorities would act ultra vires if they allowed the use of internet by prisoners. It also noted that if prisoners had access to the internet, the prison authorities would be hampered in their fight against crime by being unable to fully monitor the prisoners\u2019 activities. Furthermore, under the existing rules, the prisoners\u2019 post also had to go through the prison authorities, and such surveillance would be inadequate if the prisoners had access to electronic email. Under such circumstances, the prison authority\u2019s denial of access to internet was justified and legitimate.Denial of the extended visitOn 7 November 2006 the prison authorities granted the applicant\u2019s request for an extended visit by his parents on 30-31 December 2006. On 18 December 2006 the applicant was punished for violation of the prison\u2019s rules and moved to a special order group with restricted rights, after he had failed to fulfil the conditions of an earlier penalty. On 29 December 2006 the applicant was also informed that he was no longer allowed to have extended visits. The applicant lodged an appeal. On 4 May 2007 the Kaunas Regional Administrative Court upheld the refusal as legitimate. On 6 February 2008 the Supreme Administrative Court upheld the decision. The court observed that the legal right to an extended visit was restricted to those persons in the simple order group only and not extended to those in the special order group.Claim for damagesOn 18 July 2006 the prison authorities seized the personal computer which the applicant had brought into prison. Subsequently, the applicant lodged a claim for damages caused by both the seizure of his computer and the conditions of detention, which, according to the applicant, were inhuman. On 15 January 2007 the Vilnius Regional Administrative Court dismissed the claim by the applicant as unfounded. On 12 October 2007 the Supreme Administrative Court modified the decision of the lower court. The court concluded that the computer had been unlawfully seized by the prison authority. It also declared that prison conditions were satisfactory overall, except for several minor details, and that the gravity of these violations was not such as would amount to inhuman conditions or ill-treatment.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complains under Articles 10 and 14 of the Convention of the refusal to give him access to the internet. He maintains that, by this decision, his right to receive and impart information and ideas was violated and claims that the rules in force do not extend to a ban on the use of the internet by prisoners.The applicant also complains under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 about the denial of extended visits, maintaining that this amounted to punishment twice.In his application submitted on 28 August 2008, the applicant complains under Articles 3 and 14 of the Convention about the prison conditions. He maintains that he suffered discrimination due to the court\u2019s refusal to award him damages for the violation of his rights as a detainee..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022.

Gardner and Mr D. Kharitonov, lawyers practicing in London and Moscow respectively.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.1. Background information1. The applicant occupied various high-ranking positions at an investment holding company GML (Group Menatep Limited) and its subsidiary, OAO Neftyanaya kompaniya Yukos (hereinafter referred to as \u201cYukos\u201d). The applicant left Russia for Israel in 2003.2. Between 2003 and 2004 the authorities filed a series of tax claims against Yukos and also froze its assets. As a result of a series of court proceedings, the company was ordered to pay the arrears and fines. Being unable to pay, it was later declared bankrupt and eventually liquidated.3. At about the same time several high-ranking Yukos officials, including its owners, managers and lawyers, were arrested and subsequently convicted for fraud, tax evasion and money laundering. The head of the company\u2019s security department, Mr P., was convicted for organizing criminal activities, including robbery, murder and attempted murder.4. On 4 July 2003 senior investigator for especially important cases of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office Mr B. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cinvestigator B.\u201d) interviewed the applicant in the presence of his lawyer counsel D. Kh.5. On 30 July 2003 the applicant left Russia for Israel, where he acquired an Israeli nationality.2. Initial indictment and attempts of the Russian authorities to seek the applicant\u2019s extradition6. On 12 January 2004 an investigator Mr Ka. (hereinafter referred to as \u201cinvestigator Ka.\u201d) decided to prosecute the applicant for personal income tax evasion.7. On 21 January 2004 investigator Mr Ka. additionally charged the applicant with embezzlement.1. On 21 July 2004 the investigation additionally indicted the applicant in respect of the following episodes. He was accused of having organised an attempt on Mr Kol., Ms O.K., Mr Ry. and also having organised a murder of Mr Go. and Ms O.G. (Article 30 (3), 33 (3) and 105 (2) of the Criminal Code of Russia, see paragraphs 153, 154 and 156 respectively below). The authorities declared an international search for the applicant.9. On 23 July 2004 the Basmannyy District Court of Moscow decided to arrest the applicant in his absence.10. On 7 July 2005 the Russian authorities made a request to Israel for the applicant\u2019s extradition on the basis of the allegation of his involvement in the mentioned episodes.11. On 28 August 2006 the Ministry of Justice of Israel informed the Russian authorities that Israel could not grant the extradition request. It stated that the evidence produced by the Russian authorities had been inadequate.12. The investigation into the mentioned episodes was completed on an unspecified date in 2006. It appears that insofar as the investigation concerned the alleged personal tax evasion and embezzlement, the authorities decided not to pursue it.13. It appears that the Russian authorities also requested the authorities of various other countries to extradite the applicant with reference to the pending criminal case against him.14. On 13 August 2007 the Swiss Federal Tribunal ruled that Switzerland could not comply with a Russian request for mutual legal assistance concerning the applicant. It decided that all of the facts of the extradition case, taken together, \u201cclearly corroborate the suspicion that criminal proceedings have indeed been used as an instrument by the power in place, with the goal of bringing to heel the class of rich \u2018oligarchs\u2019 and sidelining potential or declared political adversaries\u201d.15. In a number of other decisions reached by various other courts and authorities, including in Cyprus, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Switzerland and the United Kingdom a variety of requests for mutual legal assistance and extradition connected with the Yukos case were rejected. In those cases the conclusion has been reached that the Russian requests were impermissibly tainted by the political nature of the Russian authorities\u2019 decision to investigate and prosecute those closely involved with Yukos. In most of the extradition cases the national courts also concluded that there was no prospect that the former Yukos employee concerned could obtain fair trial in Russia, because of their close involvement with Yukos and because of the political influence over the Russian courts related to Yukos. Similar concerns led the authorities in these countries to grant asylum to those fleeing Yukos-related prosecution in Russia.16. The Russian authorities furnished further evidence to Israel as to the applicant\u2019s pending criminal case, but on 23 October 2007 Israel reiterated its position that the evidence was insufficient to order the applicant\u2019s extradition.3. Pre-trial stage of the criminal proceedings(a) The appointment of counsel B. and counsel D.Kh.\u2019s attempts to delay the case-file examination17. On 14 December 2007 investigator B. wrote to the Moscow Bar Association seeking the appointment of a lawyer to represent the applicant.18. On 17 December 2007 investigator B. wrote to counsel D.Kh. a letter, inviting him to appear at 10.30 a.m. on 23 December 2007 to inspect the prosecution case-file. On 20 December 2007 investigator B. wrote to counsel D.Kh. another letter, inviting him to appear at 10.30 a.m. on 25 December 2007 to study the prosecution case-file.19. In response, on 20 and 24 December 2007 counsel D. Kh. requested to postpone the examination. He referred to the fact that on 23 December he would be occupied in a different criminal case, whereas on 25 December he would be on a previously scheduled vacation. He sought to postpone the examination of the file to any date after 11 January 2008, confirming that the applicant\u2019s defence intended to study all criminal case file materials and to exercise its procedural rights. Counsel D.Kh.\u2019s motions apparently remained unanswered.20. On 26 December 2007 the Moscow Bar Association appointed a lawyer, counsel L., to act as the applicant\u2019s representative in the criminal case. Counsel L. agreed to study the criminal case and signed the confidentiality clause concerning the preliminary investigation. It does not appear that the applicant or counsel D.Kh. were informed of this appointment. Counsel L. never contacted the applicant.(b) Counsel L.\u2019s study of the case file and counsel D.Kh\u2019s attempts to complain about the investigator\u2019s actions21. Counsel L. started to study the case file on 26 December 2007. He was to examine 84 volumes of case files of up to 300 pages each (18,926 pages in total, comprising the records of more than 500 witnesses, numerous forensic reports and other evidence), as well as physical evidence and video recordings.22. On 21 January 2008 counsel D.Kh. requested the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office to arrange to study the file.23. On 22 January 2008 counsel D.Kh. complained to the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office about the failure of the investigator to examine the first two motions (see paragraph 19 above). This complaint also drew attention to the possibility that the senior investigator might have asked another lawyer to review the case file and pointed out that this would be inconsistent with the provision of Article 50 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of the Russian Federation (see paragraph 153 below). Counsel D.Kh. asked in the complaint to investigate the circumstances of the complaint and to grant to him an opportunity to review the case. The complaint remained unanswered.24. On 31 January 2008 counsel L. confirmed having completed the study of case-file. He was issued with an electronic copy of the applicant\u2019s indictment of 18 December 2007. Counsel L. also moved for a preliminary hearing. Under Article 229 of the Criminal Procedure Code (see paragraph 161 below) as a result of a preliminary hearing some evidence could be excluded from the case-file, the case could be sent back to the prosecution, the case could be suspended or terminated, and a question of possible participation of jurors could also be resolved. When submitting that motion, counsel L. stated that he had no motions to summon witnesses for the defence, experts or specialists. He did not make any other motions for the defence.25. In a letter dated 15 January 2008 (dispatched on 4 February 2008), the investigator wrote to counsel D.Kh., refusing to recognise him as the applicant\u2019s lawyer, unless he presented proof. He further considered that counsel D.Kh. avoided his professional obligations in the case and informed him about possible arrangements to study the case file.26. By a letter of the investigator dated 12 January 2008 (dispatched on 5 February 2008 and received on 14 February 2008), counsel D.Kh. received a decision, by which his motion of 24 December 2007 to postpone the examination of the criminal case file was rejected. It was stated in the decision that the motion had been filed on 10 January 2008.27. On 6 February 2008 counsel D.Kh. filed a complaint with the Basmanny District Court of Moscow regarding the senior investigator\u2019s inaction, namely his failure to respond, or to notify him of any decision made as to his request to be permitted to examine the file.28. On 11 February 2008 the court notified the prosecution of the hearing date on 26 February 2008, followed up by another letter to the same effect sent on 12 February 2008.29. According to a record in the case file, the court started the trial on 12 February 2008, but it did not actually conduct the proceedings on that day because of the absence of both the prosecution and defence. The court adjourned the proceedings until 26 February 2008. Counsel D.Kh. was not notified about that hearing.(c) The indictment of 14 February 2008 and subsequent court hearings30. On 12 February 2008 counsel D.Kh. was notified of the hearing scheduled for 26 February 2008.31. On 14 February 2008 the case file together with the final indictment was sent to the Moscow City Court for examination on the merits. On the same day, a copy of the indictment was served on counsel L., but not on the applicant or counsel D.Kh.32. According to the indictment, the applicant created a criminal group, which included Mr Go., Mr Gor., Mr S., Mr R., Mr T., Mr O., Mr A.P., Mr Kor., Mr Po., Mr E., Mr Kab. A criminal case against Mr Go. and Mr Gor. had earlier been terminated due to their deaths. The other members of the group had earlier been convicted for participation in the same episodes now attributed to the applicant. In particular, the applicant was indicted with having organised the murders of Ms Ko., Mr Pe., Mr Fe., Mr Go. and Ms O.G. and attempted murders of Mr Kok., Mr Kol., Mr Ry., Ms O.K., Mr Iv. and Mr Fil.33. On 17 February 2008 the applicant wrote to the Moscow City Court, stating that his defence counsel had been bypassed through an appointment of a sham counsel, who never contacted the applicant, but had allegedly examined the very voluminous case file on his behalf in a very short span of time.34. On 18 February 2008 counsel D.Kh. wrote to the Moscow City Court, enclosing an authority form authorising him to act on the applicant\u2019s behalf in this case.35. Counsel L. was quoted by the Russian nation-wide newspaper Kommersant on 21 February 2008 as stating that he saw no reason to contact or speak with the applicant about his appointment.36. On 21 February 2008 counsel D.Kh. filed complaints with the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office and the Investigative Committee against the investigator\u2019s actions, which crippled the applicant\u2019s rights at the pre-trial stage of the proceedings.37. On 26 February 2008 the Basmannyy District Court, acting as a judicial review court in respect of the actions of the investigation, disallowed counsel D.Kh.\u2019s complaint of 06 February 2008 about the delays in examination of counsel D.Kh.\u2019s motion of 21 January 2008. The court stated that it had no authority to supervise the investigator\u2019s actions during the pre-trial period now that this stage was over.4. Preliminary hearings in the case and the arrangement for the case-file study by counsel D.Kh.(a) The hearing of 4 and 5 March 200838. On 4 March 2008 the Moscow City Court, acting as a first instance court in the applicant\u2019s criminal case, held a preliminary hearing. Counsel L. did not attend. Presiding judge N. (hereinafter referrred to as \u201cthe judge\u201d) asked the parties if they had any motions. Counsel D.Kh. was unhappy that the prosecution had failed to give him a copy of the final indictment. In response, the judge offered him a copy, having explained that this would constitute notification and would not be in breach of the domestic law.39. Counsel D.Kh. moved to return the case to the prosecution. He considered, in particular, that the late notification of indictment at the preliminary hearing (instead of at an earlier stage of the proceedings) was in breach of the domestic law and made it impossible for the trial court to rule on it (Article 237 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, see paragraph 162 below); that the investigation failed to inform the defence about the composition of the investigative team, which deprived them of a right to challenge investigators (Article 163 (2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, see paragraph 155 below); that the expert examination ordered by the investigation had been invalid because the applicant had been unaware of them and therefore deprived of his procedural rights in connection with it; that the defence could not study the case-file and exercise its procedural rights in this connection (Article 217 of the Criminal Procedure Code, see paragraph 159 below). In addition, counsel D.Kh. sought to delay the proceedings by three months to give him time to study the file.40. On 5 March 2008 the judge examined counsel D.Kh.\u2019s request for more time and gave him fourteen days to study the file starting from that date.41. According to the applicant, the 14 days granted by the judge for the purpose of reviewing the case file fell on holidays and weekends. As a result, there were only seven and a half working days that could be used for the study of the file.42. The judge further refused as unfounded the motions to return the case to the prosecution. It stated, in particular, that any alleged breaches of the domestic law could be remedied in court, that counsel L. properly represented and defended the applicant\u2019s procedural rights, that counsel D.Kh. essentially protracted the proceedings, which made it necessary to appoint counsel L., that, despite the applicant\u2019s decision to flee, his rights were adequately secured by two counsels, counsel L. and counsel D.Kh., and that a copy of the indictment had been served on the defence through notification of counsel L. That decision was not amenable to appeal.43. The trial was due to start at 10.00 a.m. on 19 March 2008.(b) The applicant\u2019s appeal against the Moscow City Court decisions of 4 and 5 March 200844. On 6 March 2008 counsel D.Kh. again complained that the time for study of the file was insufficient, this time to the Supreme Court, acting on appeal.45. Counsel D.Kh. received a copy of the applicant\u2019s final indictment on 6 March 2008.(c) The applicant\u2019s various motions to the Moscow City Court46. On 7 March 2008 counsel D.Kh. requested the Moscow City Court to have access to a copy of the transcript of the hearing of 4 March 2008. The request was made again in a letter sent to the judge on 12 March 2008. These requested remained unanswered.47. On 17 March 2008 counsel D.Kh. filed with the Moscow City Court an authority form (\u201c\u043e\u0440\u0434\u0435\u0440 \u2116 25, 07.03.2008\u201d) issued by his law firm confirming his powers to act on the applicant\u2019s behalf at the Moscow City Court. On the same day counsel D.Kh. informed the Moscow Bar Association about his authority to act on the applicant\u2019s behalf.(d) Case-file study by counsel D.Kh.48. During the 14 days granted by the judge on 5 March 2008 counsel D.Kh. studied the file each time when this was possible (except for 14 March 2008, when he was unavailable). As a result, he reviewed 10 out of 84 volumes in the case.5. Trial proceedings(a) Preliminary issues before the beginning of the trial49. On 19 March 2008 the judge put in doubt D.Kh.\u2019s authority to act on the applicant\u2019s behalf. In response, counsel D.Kh. showed the judge a receipt of his authority by the Moscow City Court on 17 March 2008.50. Counsel L. failed to show on that day and he also stopped attending the court hearings in the applicant\u2019s case altogether.51. According to the applicant, the judge made no steps to ensure counsel L.\u2019s participation in the proceedings.52. Counsel D.Kh. unsuccessfully challenged the judge, accusing him of personal bias. He relied, in particular, on the judge\u2019s unwillingness to give counsel more time.53. Counsel D.Kh. then moved to postpone the trial for two months in order to complete the study of the case file which consisted of sixteen volumes. The judge denied the motion, having stated that counsel D.Kh. had first been invited to study the case on 18 December 2007 and since then had been procrastinating. The judge asserted that the motion was intended to delay the examination of the case and decided that counsel D.Kh. could review the case file after each trial session.54. As regards the essence of the criminal case, counsel D.Kh. explained that the applicant denied his guilt and deplored the lack of an adequate time for preparation and emphasised the need to study the entire case file.(b) The applicant\u2019s conviction and the evidence against him55. As a result of the trial, the applicant was convicted to life imprisonment on account of six episodes:(a) organising, in liaison with Mr P., the murder of Ms Ko. The conviction was essentially based on the statements of witnesses Mr S. and Mr O.;(b) organising, in liaison with Mr P., the murder of Mr Pe. The conviction was essentially based on the statements of witnesses Mr S., Mr T., Mr R., Mr Pi. and Mr G.;(c) organising, in liaison with Mr P., the robbery of Kol. The conviction was essentially based on the statements of witnesses Mr A.P., Mr T., Mr R. and Mr S.;(d) organising, in liaison with Mr P., the attempted murder of Mr Ry., the murder of Mr Fe. and the attempted murder of Mr I.Fi. and Mr E.Fi. The conviction was essentially based on the statements of witnesses Mr Ry., Mr D., Mr G., Mr Sk., Mr R., Mr T., Mr S., Ms O. and Mr A.P.;(e) organising, in liaison with Mr P., the attempted murder of Ms O.K. The conviction was essentially based on the statements of Mr A.P. and Ms O.K.;(f) organising, in liaison with Mr P., the murder of Mr Go. and Ms O.G. The conviction was essentially based on the statements of Mr A.P. and Mr Kor.(c) The events of the trial56. The examination of the witnesses at the trial did not take place in a specific order. It does not appear that counsel D.Kh. had any access to information on the exact order of attendance.(i) Questioning of Mr Si., Mr Ry.and Mr D.K. on 20 March 200857. On 20 March 2008 during the examination of witness Mr Si. counsel D.Kh. stated that he was unfamiliar with statements by this witness because he had not been granted time to review the case file and that he would ask questions only based on his statements made in court.58. In response to questioning by counsel D.Kh. on 20 March 2008, Mr Ry. indicated that he had been interrogated during the investigation 65 times. Counsel D.Kh. asked the court for two hearing days to allow him to study all 65 interrogation records, as well as documents involving East Petroleum\u2019s litigation which were essential to the understanding of the case. The court dismissed the motion on the ground that the defence had had three months to review all criminal case file materials after the conclusion of preliminary investigation.59. On 20 March 2008 during the examination of victim Mr D.K., counsel D.Kh. stated that the defence was unfamiliar with his written evidence given at the pre-trial stage of proceedings and unsuccessfully sought further two months to review the case file.(ii) Questioning of Mr A and Mr X on 20 March 200860. On 21 March 2008 the court examined witnesses Mr A. and Mr X. The applicant\u2019s counsel stated that he was unfamiliar with the records of their interrogations and pointed out his inability fully to participate as his questions would be based only on the witnesses\u2019 evidence given to the trial court.61. According to the applicant, during the examination of witness Mr X. the judge reminded the witness the name of a street, to which counsel D.Kh. objected.(iii) The attendance of witnesses on 24-27 March 200862. On 24 March 2008 the court was informed by the prosecution that victim Ms O.K. and Ms I. would give evidence the following day. Counsel D.Kh. used the period after the court session to review their interrogation records.63. It appears that on 25 March 2008 these witnesses failed to attend and that instead the court heard victim Mr Iv. and witnesses Mr Bor., Mr G. and Mr Sh. It does not appear that counsel D.Kh. knew that these people would attend the hearing on that day and be heard.64. As regards Ms O.K. and Ms I., they gave their evidence on 18 April and 26 March 2008 respectively.65. As regards witness Mr G., counsel D.Kh. asked for additional time for preparation until the following day with reference to the need to review the file. The judge granted him 45 minutes.66. On 27 March 2008 witnesses Mr D. and Mr V.K. appeared at the hearing despite not being on the list of witnesses summoned for that day. Counsel D.Kh. was given half an hour to review their pre-trial statements to prepare.67. Ms I. asked witness Mr V.K. about the identity of potential beneficiaries of the death of Ms Ko. In response, counsel D.Kh. asked the judge to disallow the question on the ground that the witness should testify about the circumstances of the case rather than express her opinion. The judge permitted the question regardless. Mr V.K. stated in the court that, in his view, \u201cit was all coming from [the applicant]\u201d.68. Counsel D.Kh. asked for permission to read out Mr V.K.\u2019s statements, but was only permitted to read parts containing contradictions. Counsel D.Kh. challenged the statements of this witness arguing that the applicant\u2019s name had not been not mentioned during the interrogations. The court rejected the applicant\u2019s challenge on the ground that \u201cthe witness [had not] asked a question about the organizer of the crime and about those involved in it\u201d.(iv) The applicant\u2019s letter of 27 March 2008 to the trial court69. On 27 March 2008 the applicant personally sent a letter to the Moscow City Court. He stated that he had received the summons only after the trial had begun, that the allegations against him had no factual basis, that the proceedings were unfair, that the officially appointed counsel had been ineffective and that counsel D.Kh. had been deprived of the opportunity properly to prepare defence. He also stated that the prosecution was politically motivated.(v) Judge\u2019s alleged comments relating to the prosecutor\u2019s statements on 2 April 200870. According to the applicant, on 2 April 2008 the prosecutor stated in the hearing that there were reports and statements on surveying the residential area and the murder scene of Mr Pe. The judge responded as follows: \u201cHere, you have to mark c.p. 3-4: reports, and c.p. 115-21 \u2013 information memorandum\u201d.71. The defence objected to the actions of the judge which it deemed as having actively assisted the prosecution. The judge rejected the objections.(vi) The events in the proceedings on 7-10 April 200872. On 7 April 2008 witness Mr Nu. was examined. According to the applicant, the witness was not listed in the indictment. The prosecutor asked the witness a question about the procedure for obtaining Israeli citizenship and inquired as to what he knew regarding the applicant obtaining that citizenship. Counsel D. Kh. objected against asking that question to the witness, but his objection was dismissed.73. On 9 April 2008 the applicant\u2019s appeal against the decision of the Basmanny District Court of Moscow of 26 February 2008 was rejected (see paragraph 37).74. On 10 April 2008 witness Mr S. was questioned in the hearing.(vii) The applicant\u2019s objection against the prosecutor\u2019s reliance on certain documents on 16 April 200875. On 16 April 2008 counsel D.Kh. submitted that the prosecutor had referred in his submissions in court to certain documents, which were never examined in court. He also submitted that these documents were not probative of the offences of which the applicant had been accused.76. The prosecutor, in reply, refused to give any clarifications and promised to comment later. According to the applicant, he never did so.(viii) Court decision of 18 April 2008 to disallow the applicant\u2019s question to Ms O.K.77. On 18 April 2008 witness Ms O.K. was questioned in the court hearing. The applicant wished to ask the witness about the time when the witness had become an FSB advisor and on whose initiative. The judge disallowed the question as irrelevant.(ix) Questioning of Mr R. and Mr T. on 21 April 200878. On 21 April 2008 witness Mr R. was examined in the hearing. He stated that he had only heard the applicant\u2019s name from his interrogators and only then started to mention him during interviews.79. On 21 April 2008 witness Mr T. was examined in the hearing. Mr T. stated that on 16 April 2008 the senior investigator visited him in the detention centre, to which he had been transferred for the purpose of giving evidence in the applicant\u2019s trial, and told him to give the same evidence as he had done in the trial of Mr P. He further stated that he had implicated Mr P. in his evidence after the senior investigator had offered him a reduced sentence if he were to cooperate in this way and to implicate Mr P. The judge claimed that the witness was always changing his statements. The prosecutor submitted a motion to read the pre-trial statements of the witness. Counsel D.Kh. objected to the motion, stating that the court had taken inculpatory stance and was \u2018indulging the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office\u2019. The judge granted the motion and reprimanded Counsel D.Kh. for \u2018totally baseless contempt of court\u2019 and warned him that he would be removed from the courtroom if he did not change his behaviour.(x) Questioning of Mr P. and the judge\u2019s inquiry about the statements of Mr T. on 23 April 200880. On 23 April 2008 Mr P. was questioned in the court hearing. He talked about the use of psychotropic drugs on him in the course of the interrogation. The witness insisted on his own innocence and refused to incriminate the applicant. Counsel D.Kh. requested the records of the witness interrogation of 15 July 2003 from criminal investigation file no. 18/35-03 or from the criminal case examined by the Moscow City Court to be read in court. He also asked to suspend the examination of this witness until the court had the interrogation record available. The judge denied the motion on the ground that the record was irrelevant to the criminal case under examination and that Counsel D.Kh. could request the record on his own.81. On 23 April 2008 the judge announced that he had made an inquiry on 22 April 2008 to Remand prison no. 1 as to how long Mr T. had been there and whether he had been visited by anyone from the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office. The reply to the inquiry stated that the witness arrived there on 13 April 2008 and that no one visited him at the detention facility between that day and 21 April 2008. The judge consequently drew the conclusion that Mr T. had \u2018made the whole thing up\u2019.(xi) The applicant\u2019s attempt to challenge the judge on 24 April 200882. On 24 April 2008 counsel D.Kh. moved to enter into the record the interrogation of Mr P. by investigator De. at the investigative detention facility on 15 July 2003. The judge denied that motion, saying the record of interrogation was irrelevant. Counsel D.Kh. moved to recuse the judge on the ground that the judge had made evaluation of the statements of Mr T. the previous day. The judge denied the motion on the ground that he had no direct or indirect interest in the outcome of the case.(xii) Reading of pre-trial statements of witnesses on 25 April 200883. On 25 April 2008 the statements of Mr Go. and victim Mr Kok. were read because it was impossible for them to appear in court. On the same day the judge also granted the motion of the prosecution to read the statements of Ms Kop., Ms M., Mr Y., Mr Ga., Mr Z., Mr Bo. and Mr Pa. Counsel D.Kh. objected with reference to the fact that the reasons given were either insufficient to justify the reading of statements or there were doubts about the actual existence of the documents, or that the copies of the documents had not been properly authenticated. The objection did not apply to the first witness of this list who had died. On the same day the judge refused a motion by counsel D.Kh. to read the record of interrogation of Mr Y.(xiii) The decision of the Israeli Supreme Court of 14 May 2008 on the applicant\u2019s extradition request towards Russia84. On 14 May 2008 the Israeli Supreme Court, acting on appeal, confirmed the decision not to extradite the applicant. It noted, in particular, that the Israeli Ministry of Justice had reached its decision to decline extradition after comprehensive and thorough examination of the evidence. The Israeli Supreme Court stated that the test as to whether the evidence of the applicant\u2019s involvement in the alleged crimes existed was \u201cnot a trial on the merits\u201d but intended to establish whether \u201caccording to the laws of evidence accepted in Israel ... the prosecution is in possession of admissible evidence (apart from hearsay...), which is such as to justify prosecution and enquiry into the guilt or innocence of the accused\u201d.85. The Israeli Supreme Court also noted:\u201cThe extradition request dealt with five events in the course of which several citizens met their deaths and others were injured. According to the suspicion, the applicant sent henchmen to do those acts but in the evidence which was produced in the extradition request there was not a single piece of direct evidence linking the applicant to involvement in those acts. In four incidents the evidence was limited to the admissions of the henchmen, who asserted on interrogation that the person who had sent them had claimed to them that he himself had been sent by the applicant. Those who committed the offences had therefore never met the applicant and merely heard from a third person that it was he who stood behind the commission of the offences. That is hearsay which is not admissible according to the law applicable in Israel. Here it is appropriate to mention that the particular third party, whose version might have shed light on the whole affair, was not called to give evidence, because, according to the extradition request, he was murdered in November 2002. That last occurrence is also attributed to the applicant, although the extradition request does not specify a single piece of evidence connecting the applicant with it.\u201d(xiv) Examination of witnesses on 21 May \u2013 02 June 200886. On 21 May 2008 counsel D.Kh. was given the names of witnesses to be called at the six hearings between 27 May 2008 and 3 June 2008. There were 115 witnesses on that list in total with around 20 witnesses per hearing.87. The applicant alleges that most of these witnesses failed to appear in court and that the court heard some other witnesses, not mentioned on the list at all, instead. According to the applicant, counsel D.Kh. received no proper notification about the appearance of these witnesses and could not prepare.88. On 27 May 2008 witness Mr Sk., a witness not listed in the indictment, was examined.89. On the same day counsel D.Kh. submitted a motion to read the record of the interrogation of witness Ms Mi. The motion was granted.90. On 27 May 2008 witness Ms Ba. was questioned in the court hearing. According to the applicant, the judge displayed bias by actively talking to the witness and putting her questions, instead of listening to the answers given in responses to the parties\u2019 questions.91. On 28 May 2008 witness Mr Ye., a witness not listed in the indictment, was examined in court.92. On 28 May 2008 the defence moved to call Mr Kol. for a supplementary examination as a victim. The request was granted.93. On 28 May 2008, upon the motion of the prosecutor, the statements by witnesses Mr Dr. and Mr Shi. were read out in the court hearing. The defence objected to admitting the evidence of Mr Shi. in this form, as that evidence could not be tested.94. On 29 May 2008 the judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to read the statements and records of interrogation of Ms Kar. and Ms Ma., as they could not appear in court. The defence objected to the motion. The statement of Ms Ma. related to Ms O.G., whose murder the applicant was accused of ordering. The evidence of Ms Ma. concerned an alleged meeting between the witness and two Yukos employees.95. On 30 May 2008 witness Mr Kon. was questioned in the court hearing. The judge questioned the witness on the motives of the involvement of Mr P. in the murder of Mr Pe. and about the relations between Mr P. and the applicant.96. On 02 June 2008 witness Mr O. was questioned in a hearing by Mr D.Kh. He testified that the investigators had asked him to incriminate the applicant under threat of being charged as an organiser of a crime group.97. On 2 June 2008 Counsel D.Kh. submitted a motion to send a summons to Mr Ry. in order to examine him as a victim. The court denied the motion, noting that it was unnecessary since Mr Ry. had been examined previously and counsel D.Kh. had had a chance to ask him questions.(xv) Watching of video evidence by the court and the applicant\u2019s requests to call witnesses for further examination between 2 June and 14 July 200898. On 2 June 2008 the prosecutor moved to read Mr T.\u2019s statements and watch a video cassette of his interrogation. Counsel D.Kh. objected to the motion citing Article 281 (1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure (see paragraph 167 below) which permitted such reading out or viewing \u2018with the consent of the parties in the case of the non-appearance of the victim or witness\u2019, while in the present case Mr T. had appeared and testified previously before the court. The court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion, as the law did not prohibit the reading out of statements and viewing a video cassette in an individual\u2019s absence. After viewing the video recording of the supplemental interrogation of Mr T., counsel D.Kh. referred to the fact that the witness statements made during the preliminary investigation had been explained by Mr T. at the trial on 21 April 2008 as arising from the investigator\u2019s offer to him of a reduced sentence if he implicated Mr P. and the applicant.99. On 3 June 2008 the prosecutor asked the court to view a video recording of Mr R.\u2019s statement of 16 June 2005. The defence objected, stating that Mr R. had been examined and the prosecutor had had the opportunity to ask him any questions. The judge granted the motion.100. On 3 June 2008 the prosecutor asked the court to view the video cassette with the recording of Mr Go.\u2019s automobile inspection. Counsel D. Kh. did not object to the motion, and it was granted. The judge suggested, on his own initiative, that the examination of the area near Khovanskoye cemetery should also be viewed on the same cassette.101. Mr Ne. and Mr Sm. were examined on 9 and 10 June 2008 respectively. Counsel D.Kh. was not advised that these particular witnesses would be appearing at these specific hearings. During the questioning of witness Mr Ne. the judge indicated that \u201cthere are also different budget line items; you can\u2019t allocate to salaries alone\u201d. Counsel D.Kh. objected to the comments of the judge, stating that \u201cit is the witness who testified, not the judge who should explain what happened in Nefteyugansk\u201d.102. On 10 June 2008 the judge granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion to view a video cassette with the recording of a recreational trip to the mountains by Yukos executives and an interview with Mr G. given on television. Mr D.Kh. objected that the interview could not be examined at the proceedings, stating that it was not physical evidence within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Code of Russia.103. On 11 June 2008 the prosecutor entered a motion to hear Mr Kor.\u2019s and Mr A.P.\u2019s videotaped statements in the interests of \u2018fullness of court examination\u2019. Counsel D.Kh. objected, indicating that the law did not provide for the right to hear such statements on the ground announced by the prosecutor. He further stated that Mr Kor. and Mr A.P. had earlier been examined in court, and the prosecutor did not claim that there were any contradictions in their statements at the time. The judge permitted the viewing of the statements.104. On 25 June 2008 the judge\u2019s clerk told the assistant of counsel D.Kh. that the prosecutor would ask to view two more video cassettes and would then finish presenting the evidence. The clerk had indicated that the judge had asked that it be passed on to the applicant\u2019s lawyer, that the defence should try to ensure that the witnesses for the defence appear in court between 30 June and 04 July 2008 and that defence witnesses could be brought the week after but that would be highly undesirable.105. On 8 July 2008 a video recording of the interrogation of witness Mr S. was shown in court. The applicant\u2019s lawyer objected to the court receiving the video evidence, stating that such a video may only be viewed after his statements were read. He subsequently made a motion, asking for Mr S. to be summoned in court. The motion was rejected.106. On 9 July 2008 counsel D.Kh. moved for Mr R. to be examined again on matters arising from his written statements in the course of interrogations during the preliminary investigation, which were read out at the prosecutor\u2019s request. The motion was rejected by the judge. Counsel D.Kh. also asked the judge to grant him three weeks in order to prepare for the presentation of the evidence. He was granted three working days in this respect.107. On 14 July 2008 the applicant moved to summon and conduct supplemental examination of victims Ms Kol. and Mr Ry. The motion was rejected by the judge on the ground that these victims had already been examined in the court in detail.(xvi) The motions of the defence on 14 July 2008108. On 14 July 2008 counsel D. Kh. asked the court to summon witnesses Mr Lu., Mr V.S., Mr F., Mr S.B., Mr Y.K., Mr Tz., Mr Kl., Mr Mu., Mr Xa., Mr And. and Mr As. Summonses had earlier been sent by the court to all of these witnesses, but the witnesses did not respond. The first three witnesses had not been interrogated during the preliminary investigation, the rest of them were examined during preliminary investigation. The judge denied that motion. He also stated that the defense was entitled to ask that the statements, which had been given by the witnesses during preliminary investigation, were read out in court. Counsel D.Kh. then asked the court for the opportunity to question Mr Kh. at his place of incarceration. The judge denied that motion on the basis that Mr Kh. was not at that time within the jurisdiction of the Moscow City Court. the judge also stated that the defence had the right to ask his place of incarceration \u2013 a correctional facility in the city of Chita \u2013 for permission to question him.109. On 14 July 2008 counsel D.Kh. moved to exclude the video cassette of the interview with Mr G. and of the Yukos trip to the mountains, as well as the records of interrogations and videotaped statements of witness Mr T. on the grounds that they were irrelevant. The judge denied the motion on the basis that there were no procedural violations committed in obtaining these items of evidence.110. On 14 July 2008 counsel D.Kh. submitted a motion to examine and adduce documents in the criminal case, namely: a copy of the 14 May 2008 Israeli Supreme Court decision in Mr Nu.\u2019s and Mr E.S.\u2019s petition to strip the applicant of his State of Israel citizenship and extradite him to Russia; a copy of the 13 August 2007 decision by Switzerland\u2019s First Public Law Court of the Swiss Federal Tribunal on the applicant\u2019s complaint against the 15 December 2006 decision by the Swiss Federal Prosecutor\u2019s Office regarding International Legal Assistance to the Russian Federation, as well as copies of Statement and documents with reference to which the Swiss Federal Supreme Court made a decision in the case; a copy of the 10 April 2008 decision by Nicosia\u2019s District Court regarding Russian Federation\u2019s request to extradite Mr V.Ka.; a copy of the English Bow Street Magistrates Court decision of 18 March 2005 regarding Russian Federation Government\u2019s request for International Legal Assistance and Extradition of Mr Mar. and Ms C.; a copy of the English Bow Street Magistrates Court decision regarding the Russian Federation Government\u2019s request for the extradition of Mr Te.; a copy of the 24 August 2007 decision by the Senior Prosecutor of the Department of International Relations and Legal Assistance of the Lithuanian Republic\u2019s General Prosecutor\u2019s Office Request to take into custody and extradite Russian Federation citizen Br.; statements by Mr Du., Mr She., Mr V.Sh., Mr Li. and Mr Pav. The judge agreed to admit the copy of the Israeli Supreme Court decision, the Swiss Federal Tribunal\u2019s decision on the applicant\u2019s complaint, and statements by Mr She., Mr Du., Mr V.Sh. and Mr Pav. The rest of the motion was denied by the judge. The part of the motion concerning adducing the documents was denied by the judge on the basis that he considered them to have no relevance to the case.111. On 14 July 2008 counsel D. Kh. submitted a motion for recusal of the judge, noting that he was not given sufficient time for preparation of presentation of defence evidence, the defence was deprived of the opportunity to examine the victims and certain witnesses, as well as to adduce certain documents to the case file, the motion of the defence to exclude evidence obtained in violation of law was denied. The judge refused to deal with the motion, stating that he had already twice dealt with similar recusal motions, submitted by the defence. After that counsel D.Kh. submitted a statement regarding the political motivation for prosecuting the applicant and regarding the impossibility to continue presenting evidence.(xvii) Reading out of the statements of absent witnesses on 15 July 2008112. On 15 July 2008 the prosecutor entered a motion to read out statements by six witnesses \u2013 Mr V. Sh., Mr Du., Mr Br., Mr Ta., Mr Pav. and Mr She. Counsel D.Kh. did not object to the motion, because one of the witnesses had since died and the remaining witnesses were abroad. On the same day the prosecutor entered a second motion to read out statements by over twenty witnesses: Mr Zo., Mr D.D., Mr Kal., Mr A.Sh., Mr A.Y., Ms R. P., Mr V.Y., Mr S.K., Mr Baz., Ms Za., Ms N.K., Mr Boc., Ms T.Sh., Ms N.Ko., Mr Be., Mr Pi., Mr Ash., Mr So., Mr Ru. and Mr Sa. The prosecutor cited as a ground for doing so that the summons sent to these witnesses had been returned to the court by the post office as the individuals concerned had not come to the post office to pick them up or they did not reside at the stated addresses.113. Counsel D.Kh. objected to the reading of the statements of the witnesses without an opportunity to examine them. The court granted the motion, stating that the summons had been sent to the witnesses, but they did not appear in court for various reasons.114. Statements by Mr Pi., Ms T. Sh., Mr Be., Ms N.K., Mr A.Sh. and Mr Zo. were read out on 15 July 2018. The remaining statements were read out the following day.(xviii) The motion of the defence dated 16 July 2008 to summon additional witnesses115. On 16 July 2008 counsel D.Kh. asked the court to summon witnesses Mr A.Sh., Mr Pi., Mr Zo., Mr Sa., Mr Kal. after evidence taken from them during the preliminary investigation had been read out by the prosecution, but the motion was rejected. After that the judge announced a recess until 23 July 2008, setting oral arguments for that date.(xix) Closing speech of the prosecutor on 23 July 2008116. On 23 July 2008 the prosecutor read a closing speech. The prosecutor changed the charge in relation to Mr Kol. so that the applicant became charged with organising Mr Kol.\u2019s assault and robbery. The prosecutor also stated that Mr T. had tried to falsely accuse the prosecutors, which is why he recanted his testimony and so his earlier statements have to be believed. The prosecutor also asked the court to exclude both the Swiss and Israeli court decisions as inadmissible evidence, saying that they were irrelevant, did not contain information on the object to be proven, the translator had not been warned about criminal liability for deliberately false translation and that there were no judge\u2019s signatures. Counsel D. Kh. asked to be provided with a copy of the closing speech. The prosecutor did not allow him to make a copy of it. According to the trial transcript, the court granted the prosecutor\u2019s motion and entered the written version of the prosecutor\u2019s speech into the record. Counsel D.Kh. asked for a week to prepare in order to analyze the prosecutor\u2019s position. The judge set the next court session for 10.00 am the following day.(xx) Closing remarks of counsel D.Kh. on 24 July 2008 and the end of the trial117. On 24 July 2008 counsel D.Kh. gave his concluding remarks, saying that the charges against the applicant were unsubstantiated and unproven. He emphasised that both the pre-trial proceedings and the conduct of the trial had failed to observe the requirements of the Russian law and the European Convention on Human Rights. At the end of the closing submissions the judge announced that the judgment would be read out on 1 August 2008 and withdrew to prepare it.118. The trial ended on 01 August 2008.(d) The judgment of 1 August 2008119. By the judgment of the Moscow City Court of 1 August 2008 which counted 160 pages the applicant was found guilty of committing the following crimes:(i) Organising, in liaison with Mr P., the murder of Ms Ko., which was carried out on 21 January 1998 in Moscow by Mr S. aided and abetted by Mr O., who had earlier been convicted by separate judgments.120. Ms Ko. was an owner of a shop in Moscow. According to the judgment, Mr Go. and another person negotiated with Ms Ko. about a possible buy-out, asking her to sell the shop\u2019s premises or to join the charter fund run by the Menatep Bank as a co-founder, in order to enable the reconstruction of the whole building. When the negotiations failed, the applicant gave instructions to Mr P. to organise the murder of Ms Ko. Mr P. suggested to his acquaintance Mr Go. to look for possible candidates to carry out the contract. Mr Go. hired Mr S. and Mr O. to carry out the murder. The murder was carried out by Mr S., who had arrived at the crime scene together with Mr O. and Mr Go.121. The applicant\u2019s conviction was based, essentially:- on the statements of Mr S., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that Mr P. had acted on the instruction of the applicant and that the applicant had financed the murder, providing funds to Mr P.;- on the statements of Mr O., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that Mr Go. told him that the applicant had financed the murder. He also stated that he heard Mr Go. saying after the murder that Mr P. and the applicant were \u201cnow on the hook\u201d.According to the applicant, in respect of this episode, the court also relied on pre-trial statements of witnesses Mr V. K., Mr Sm., Mr Si., and also Mr Sh., which were not read out or examined in court.(ii) Organizing, in liaison with Mr P., the murder of Mr Pe., which was carried out on 26 June 2008 in Nefteyugansk by Mr R., aided and abetted by Mr T. and Mr S., who had earlier been convicted by separate judgments122. Mr Pe. was a mayor of Nefteyugansk of the Khanty-Mansiysk Autonomous District. According to the court judgment, the motive for killing was to impede Mr Pe.\u2019s actions, which were aimed at the collection of taxes to the local budget that had earlier been underpaid by Yukos. The applicant gave instructions to Mr P. to organise the murder of Mr Pe. Mr P. suggested to his acquaintance Mr Go. to look for candidates for this job. Mr Go. offered to Mr S. and Mr Gor. to carry out the murder. They agreed and, in turn, hired their acquaintances Mr R. and Mr T. to carry out the murder for remuneration. The murder was carried out by Mr R., who had arrived at the crime scene together with Mr T.123. The applicant\u2019s conviction was based, essentially:- on the statements of Mr S., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that Mr T. told him that the murder was organised by Mr P. and by the applicant;- on the statements of Mr T., who stated at the pre-trial proceedings that the crime was committed in the interests of Mr P. and the applicant, who had organised and financed that crime. He also stated that Mr Go. told him that the management of the Yukos Oil Company was interested in committing the crime. During the trial Mr T. refuted his pre-trial statements and stated that the name of the applicant was mentioned by him before the trial at the request of investigators of the General Prosecutor\u2019s Office Mr B. and Ms Ban. in exchange for a reduction of his own prison sentence. He also stated that before the court hearing the investigator came to visit him in the pre-trial detention facility, asking him to reiterate his pre-trial statements. The court relied on the witness\u2019s pre-trial statements, indicating that it received a response from the head of the pre-trial detention facility, where the witness was staying, affirming that no one had visited the applicant before he was questioned in court;- on the statements of Mr R., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that the murder was organised by Mr P. and the applicant. He further stated that Mr S. told him that the applicant and Mr P. were glad to hear the news of murder of Mr Pe.;- on the statements of Mr Pi., who stated at the pre-trial proceedings that the applicant had sent him on mission to Nefteyugansk in June 1998 in order to analyse the situation regarding the conflict between Mr Pe. and OAO Yuganskneftegaz. Mr Pi. received certain documents from the security service of Yukos Oil Company, which indicated that there were poor relations between Mr Pe. and Yukos due to the failure of Yukos to pay taxes in full amount. He arrived in Nefteyugansk on 24 June 1998, where he learned that the management of OAO Yuganskneftegaz intended to replace Mr Pe. as a mayor with another person, more loyal to Yukos. The applicant and Mr V.Sh. asked him to tell to the public and to the investigators that the wife of Mr Pe. was involved in the murder. The similar instructions were given to other Yukos employees;- on the statements of Mr G., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that the applicant told him that Yukos\u2019s official version for Mr Pe.\u2019s murder was a conflict between his wife and local criminals, who vied for control of a local market.According to the applicant, witness Ms Ol. gave some oral evidence in favour of the applicant at the trial, but this evidence was later disregarded by the court in its judgment.(iii) Organizing, in liaison with Mr P., the robbery of Mr Kol., which was carried out on 5 October 1998 in Moscow by Mr R. and Mr T., who had earlier been convicted by separate judgments124. Mr Kol. was an executive officer of ZAO Rosprom. According to the court judgment, the robbery was advantageous to the applicant since the victim\u2019s professional growth conflicted with some interests of the Yukos management. The applicant gave instructions to Mr P. to organise the murder of Mr Kol. Mr P. suggested to his acquaintance Mr Go. to look for direct perpetrators of the order. Mr Go. hired Mr A.P., but for some reason, ordered him to commit a robbery, and not murder. The latter, in turn, passed an order to his acquaintances Mr Kor., Mr Po. and Mr Kab. Later Mr Kor., Mr Po. and Mr Kab. refused to carry out the robbery, as Mr Kol. was allegedly escorted by security guards. After that Mr Go. suggested to Mr S. and Mr Gor. to participate in organizing the robbery, who agreed and hired their acquaintances Mr R. and Mr T. to carry out the robbery for remuneration. The robbery was committed jointly by Mr R. and Mr T.125. The applicant\u2019s conviction was based, essentially:- on the statements of Mr A.P., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that Mr Go. had told him approximately in 1999 that the main organiser of robbery had been the applicant, who had also financed the crime;- on the statements of Mr T., who stated at the pre-trial proceedings that the crime had been committed at the instructions of Mr P. and the applicant, who had also organised and financed it. He also stated that he received that information from Mr S., Mr Go. and Mr Gor. During the trial Mr T. refuted his pre-trial statements, arguing that he had given the names of Mr P. and the applicant at the request of the investigators;- on the statements of Mr R., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that Mr P. and the applicant had instructed Mr Gor. and Mr Go. to organise the robbery;- on the statements of Mr S., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that he had heard from Mr Go. and Mr Gor. that Mr P. and the applicant had been behind the robbery and that the robbery had been financed by the applicant.(iv) Organizing, in liaison with Mr P., the attempted murder of Mr Ry., which had been carried out on 24 November 1998 in Moscow by Mr R., aided and abetted by Mr T. and Mr S., who had earlier been convicted by separate judgments (first episode), and organizing in liaison with Mr P. the attempted murder of Mr Ry., murder of Mr Fe. and the attempted murder of Mr I.Fi. and Mr E.Fi., which had been carried out in the Moscow Region on 5 March 2009 by Mr T. and Mr R., aided and abetted by Mr S., who had earlier been convicted by separate judgments (second episode)126. Mr Ry. was the executive director of East Petroleum Handelsges.m.b.H. Company, who initiated several lawsuits against the Yukos Oil Company concerning the damage allegedly caused by the unlawful activity of Yukos to East Petroleum regarding its cooperation with OAO \u2019Tomskneft\u2019 VNK in the development of Zapadno-Poludennoye and Krapivinskoye oil fields. The applicant gave instructions to Mr P. to organize the murder of Mr Ry. Mr P. suggested to his acquaintance Mr Go. to look for direct perpetrators of the murder. Mr Go. suggested to Mr S. and Mr Gor. to participate in organising the murder, who agreed and hired their acquaintances Mr R. and Mr T. to carry out the murder for remuneration. The failed murder attempt was carried out by Mr R., who had arrived at the crime scene together with Mr T. (first episode). After the first attempt of murder failed, the applicant again gave instructions to Mr P. to organise the murder of Mr Ry. Mr P. suggested to his acquaintance Mr Go. to look for direct perpetrators of the murder. Mr Go. suggested to Mr S. and Mr Gor. to participate in organizing the murder, who agreed and hired their acquaintances Mr R. and Mr T. to carry out the murder for remuneration. Mr R. and Mr T. set the explosive device on the ground in a place, where the car of Mr Ry. was to take route. When the car approached, Mr T. initiated the explosion. Mr R. threw the grenade at the car. After that Mr T. and Mr R. shot the car from assault rifles. As a result of the assault, Mr Fe. was shot dead, Mr I.Fi. and Mr E.Fi. were injured. Mr Ry. was not present in a car and he was unaffected by the assault (second episode).127. The applicant\u2019s conviction was based, essentially:- on the statements of victim Mr Ry., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that, in his opinion, the attempted murders were organized by the Yukos management, including the applicant, because among his business partners only Yukos was in their debt; he sent a number of letters to the government structures concerning financial irregularities in Yukos; his close acquaintance Mr A.B., a former General Director of TNV Oil Company, who was murdered on 20 October 1998, told him about pressure from the Yukos Oil Company, indicating a person, who worked for the Yukos security service, who threatened him, trying to persuade to commit unlawful actions beneficial to Yukos. He later identified that person as Mr P.;- on the statements of Mr D., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that he took part in the court proceedings on the side of the East Petroleum Company against Yukos. He received a warning from an unknown person named Sergey that he should not contact Mr Ry., as he \u2018fell foul\u2019 of very influential persons. The applicant called him, insulting and threatening Mr Ry. and himself, demanding that they stop their actions against Yukos. In his opinion, the Yukos management, and the applicant in particular, organised the attempted murder of Mr Ry.;- on the statements of Mr G., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that the issue of debts of Yukos before the East Petroleum Company was discussed at various meetings held by Mr Kh. and by the applicant. At a meeting held approximately on 29 January 1999 the applicant in the presence of Mr G. told Mr Kh. that he needed 2 months so that the problem of Mr Ry. would disappear. After the attempted murder Mr G. realized that the applicant was behind the murder. The applicant held individual meetings with Yukos employees before they were questioned by the criminal authorities on the fact of the attempted murder. The applicant told Mr G. that one should not be concerned about the investigation, as the investigative authority was under his control. After the second attempt of murder Mr Kh. assigned him to negotiate with Mr Ry. regarding the buyout of shares of VNK and subsidiaries. Mr Kh. told him that Mr Ry. was too frightened by the applicant and would negotiate only with those people who had not exerted pressure upon him;- on the statements of Mr Sk., who testified at the trial that the issue of conflict between Yukos and East Petroleum was discussed among the Yukos management. He followed the media statements of Mr Ry. and transferred them to the applicant and Mr P.;- on the statements of Mr R., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that the attempted murder of Mr Ry. was organised by Mr P. and by the applicant. Mr Gor. told him that the applicant was discontent with the failure of attempted murder and told about that to Mr P., who later told Mr Gor. about that. Mr R. also stated that in March 1999 he and Mr T. were at an automobile \u2018Niva\u2019 near the hotel \u2018Salut\u2019, then there came a \u2018Jeep\u2019 with Mr S. and Mr Gor. in it, then came \u2018Volga\u2019 with Mr Go., Mr P. and the applicant, who spoke to Mr Gor. and went away. Mr Gor. and Mr S. said that if they did not manage to \u2018take out\u2019 Mr Ry. that day, \u2018their heads will roll\u2019;- on the statements of Mr T., who stated at the pre-trial proceedings that the crime was committed on the instruction of P. and the applicant, who had also organised and financed it. He also stated that he received that information from Mr S., Mr Go. and Mr Gor. He also reasserted the statements of Mr R. regarding the meeting near the hotel \u2018Salut\u2019. During the trial Mr T. refuted his pre-trial statements, arguing that he named the names of Mr P. and the applicant at the request of the investigators;- on the statements of Mr S., who testified at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that he had heard from Mr Go. and Mr Gor. that Mr P. and the applicant were behind the attempted murder, which was financed by the applicant. He also reasserted the statements of Mr R. regarding the meeting near the hotel \u2018Salut\u2019;- on the pre-trial statement of Mr O., who stated that in 2004 attorney Mr A.S. exerted pressure upon him, demanding not to disclose information about relations between Mr Go., Mr P. and the applicant;- on the statements of Mr A.P., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that Mr Go. had told him that the applicant was the organizer of the attempted murder of Mr Ry.According to the applicant, in respect of this episode, the court also relied on pre-trial statements of witnesses Mr A.Sh. and Mr Sa., Ms L.Ry., Ms N.Ry., Ms T.Ry., Ms V.Ry. and Mr Baz., which were not read out or examined in court.(v) Organising, in liaison with Mr P., the attempted murder of Ms O.K., which had been carried out on 28 November 1998 in Moscow by Mr Kor., Mr Po., Mr Kab. and Mr E., who had earlier been convicted by separate judgments128. Ms O.K. worked for the Moscow Mayor\u2019s office, having previously worked for Yukos. According to the court judgment, the attempted murder was committed due to the fact that her actions had conflicted with interests of the Yukos management. The applicant gave instructions to Mr P. to organize the murder of Ms O.K. Mr P. suggested to his acquaintance Mr Go. to look for direct perpetrators of the murder. Mr Go. suggested Mr A.P. to participate in organizing the murder, who agreed and hired his acquaintances Mr Kor. and Mr Po. to carry out the murder for remuneration. Mr Kor. and Mr Po. also suggested participating in carrying out the murder to Mr Kab., who agreed. Mr Kor., Mr Po. and Mr Kab. also suggested participating in carrying out the murder to Mr E., who agreed. The failed attempt of murder by way of explosion near the door of the victim\u2019s apartment was carried out by Mr Kor., Mr Po. and Mr Kab.129. The applicant\u2019s conviction was based, essentially:- on the statements of Mr A.P., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that Mr Go. had told him approximately in 1999 that the main organizer of robbery had been the applicant, who also financed the crime;- on the statements of victim Ms O.K., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that the applicant had hired her in Group Menatep, where she later met her future husband, which resulted in a negative reaction from the applicant, who tried to dismiss him. After that Ms O.K. had to leave the company, and the applicant warned her that the future career of her husband in the company depended on her behaviour. While working for the Moscow Mayor\u2019s office, Ms O.K. developed a concept of regional relations for the Moscow government. She was told by Mr V.Sh. and Mr Sav. that she would need to receive the applicant\u2019s approval for the document. At the meeting with her the applicant stated that she had to be the applicant\u2019s prot\u00e9g\u00e9, regardless of her place of work. After that her project was closed, while the relations between her husband and the applicant worsened. The applicant told her husband that by working against him in the Moscow Mayor\u2019s Office, she set Mr Lu. against the applicant and obstructed the work of the applicant\u2019s best friend Mr V.Sh. After that Mr V.Sh. and the applicant started to put pressure on her. The applicant told her husband that the company would take measures to protect its interests against her. The head of the analytical division of Yukos Mr Kon. reminded her that she would be fired from her office if the applicant so decided. During the telephone conversation the applicant blamed her for the problems with management of ZAO Moscow Youth Palace. After that the applicant suggested her to refer to the security services. After the attempted murder she left her job. The applicant then offered her friendship, proposed various suggestions of who might have been behind the attempted murder. Ms O.K. conceded that the applicant could have been interested in punishing her.(vi) Organising, in liaison with Mr P., the murder of Mr Go. and Ms O.G., which had been carried out on 20 November 2002 in the town of Tambov by the unidentified persons130. According to the court judgment, the applicant knew that Mr Go. had possessed information about the applicant\u2019s involvement in the above\u2011mentioned crimes and was going to disclose that information in public. He entered into criminal conspiracy with Mr P. and organised the murder Mr Go. and his wife Ms O.G. in order to conceal the committed crimes. At the applicant\u2019s instruction, Mr P. found unidentified individuals who carried out the murder.131. The applicant\u2019s conviction was based, essentially:- on the statements of Mr A.P., who stated at the trial and during the pre\u2011trial proceedings that the death of Mr Go. and his wife had been \u2018advantageous\u2019 for the applicant;- on the statements of Mr Kor., who testified at the trial and during the pre-trial proceedings that Mr Go. had showed him three photographs of men. One of them was Mr P. Mr Go. told Mr Kor. that if something were to happen to him, such as murder or accident, the only person to blame would be Mr P. Mr Go. emphasized that those three men were affiliated with Menatep Bank, he possessed compromising material against that bank, which could be transferred to the criminal authority if something happened to him. Later on during the photo array identification procedure Mr Kor. identified the applicant as one of the persons depicted on the photographs.(vii) The use of evidence given by various witnesses and alleged difference between the judgment delivered orally and in writing132. According to the applicant, the judgment read out in court differed materially from that which it subsequently issued in writing. He also alleges that the judgment repeated passages from the judgment by which Mr P. had been earlier convicted, thus incorporating the evidence of witnesses who appeared at the Mr P.\u2019s trial, but not in the proceedings against the applicant. In addition, the applicant submits that the judgment repeated passages from the judgment by which Mr P. was convicted, thus incorporating the evidence of witnesses who appeared at the Mr P.\u2019s trial, but not in the proceedings against the applicant.6. Appeal proceedings(a) The applicant\u2019s appeal complaint and the appeal arguments133. Counsel D.Kh. lodged an appeal to the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation against the judgment of the Moscow City Court of 1 August 2008. He asked the court to quash the first-instance judgment and terminate the criminal proceedings against the applicant, raising the following arguments.134. He argued that the case was investigated and considered by the lower court in breach of the relevant laws; that the applicant was deprived of sufficient time to prepare defence with the assistance of a lawyer, chosen by him before and during the court proceedings; that the principles of equality of arms and adversarial proceedings were violated; that the lower court disregarded the principle of presumption of innocence.135. He further argued that the defence was not familiarised with the case file, in violation of Article 217 of the Criminal Procedure Code (see paragraph 159 above), and could not therefore exercise its right to file motions. The court also allegedly did not provide counsel D.Kh. with sufficient time for studying the materials of the case file, thus depriving him of the opportunity to prepare the defence.136. Counsel argued that the court did not ensure the attendance of the victims in the proceedings and failed to provide him an opportunity to present evidence and question witnesses, who were not summoned by the prosecution or the defence, that the court groundlessly denied numerous motions (such as on giving three weeks to work with evidence, for summoning and questioning of victims, additional witnesses, attaching documents to the case and excluding allegedly inadmissible evidence), which allegedly denied the applicant his fair trial rights.137. Counsel further argued that there were numerous violations of the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code and that the trial judge did not pronounce the full text of the judgment, that the judgment was based on the evidence that was not examined in court, that the court failed to assess all the evidence, that the evidence of certain witnesses during the preliminary investigation had been given under the influence of investigators as a result of unlawful investigative techniques.138. Counsel D.Kh. asserted that the court had been wrong to exclude the decisions of the courts of Switzerland and Israel, by which the applicant\u2019s extradition to Russia was denied, that the court did not take into account the circumstances that could substantially influence its conclusions, that the judgment was based on presuppositions and inadmissible evidence \u2013 video recording; the record of interrogation of witness Mr T., who had allegedly been questioned under the influence of the investigator \u2013 and that the pre-trial evidence of certain witnesses had been unlawfully pronounced in court.139. Counsel D.Kh. concluded that the applicant had not committed the incriminated crimes and that the applicant\u2019s guilt had not been properly established.(b) The appeal judgment of 27 January 2009140. By the judgment of 27 January 2009 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld the judgment of the Moscow City Court of 1 August 2008.141. The Supreme Court upheld the first-instance judgment with reference to the following reasons.142. The court stated that the applicant\u2019s guilt was established in view of the aggregate evidence examined in court and thoroughly expounded upon in the judgment, that the arguments of the applicant were refuted by the materials of the case file and that they were examined by the first-instance court and properly refuted in the judgment.143. The court considered that the circumstances of the applicant\u2019s criminal activities had been confirmed by the evidence of numerous witnesses (Mr S., Mr O., Mr Sm., Mr V.K., Mr D.K., Mr T., Mr R., Mr Fiv., Ms Chi., Mr And., Ms N.Ko., Ms Dub., Mr A.P., Mr Po., Mr Kor., Mr Kos., Mr Gal., Mr G., Mr Kab. and others; victims Ms K., Ms I., Mr Kol., Ms O.K., Mr Ry., Mr Iv., Mr Fil., Ms Ded., Mr Iz.) at the pre-trial stage and before the court, on-site inspection reports, forensic medical reports, documents of the case and other material evidence.144. The court further noted that the applicant\u2019s involvement in organising murders and attempted murders as well as a robbery was fully confirmed by the evidence that was examined in court and enumerated in the judgment.145. According to the court, the arguments of the lawyer that the defence was not familiarised with the case file at the pre-trial stage as well as during the trial were groundless. It pointed out that, according to the case file, the interests of the applicant during the preliminary investigation and during the trial were represented by the lawyers, who studied the materials of the case file in full.146. The court further noted that the criminal case had been investigated and considered by the court comprehensively, fully and fairly and that there had been no violations of the criminal procedure.147. The appeal court concluded that the first instance court had examined and assessed all the collected evidence in aggregate and had come to the reasonable conclusion that the applicant\u2019s guilt was established and characterised his actions correctly.148. It viewed the conclusions of the trial court set out in the judgment as confirmed by the evidence examined during the trial. The appeal court further considered that the trial court had taken into consideration all the relevant circumstances of the case, that all of the contradictions in the evidence were examined and assessed by the trial court. The judgment explained the reasons for various procedural decisions and contained no contradictions.149. The appeal court also noted that the trial court had not made any conclusions or statements breaching the applicant\u2019s presumption of innocence, that the trial court had acted without taking sides, having merely created the necessary conditions for the parties to exercise their procedural rights and fulfil their obligations in the proceedings.150. The appeal court considered that the applicant\u2019s defence rights were fully respected and dismissed all of the applicant\u2019s arguments in this connection.151. The appeal court disagreed with the arguments of the complaint that the court had failed to ensure the presence of the victims in the hearing, had groundlessly denied the motions of the defence, had failed to give the defence an opportunity to present evidence and to question witnesses whose attendance was requested by the defence.152. The appeal court finally concluded that contrary to the arguments of the applicant\u2019s counsel, the judgment had been pronounced by the presiding judge and that the punishment had been imposed on the applicant in accordance with the law.B.

The use of untested evidence176.

The use of hearsay evidence and evidence obtained through pressure. Lack of factual basis for the prosecution of the applicant177. According to the applicant, the verdict relied on the hearsay evidence and the evidence obtained through pressure, which confirmed the lack of factual basis for the prosecution of the applicant. The applicant argues that:(a) the verdict relied entirely upon hearsay, double hearsay, speculative testimony and suppressed testimony, whereas the verdict which the trial judge read out in court differed materially from that which he subsequently issued in writing (see paragraph 132 below);(b) the statements allegedly heard from the perpetrators included one from Mr Go. who had disappeared in 2002 and had been apparently murdered and Mr Gor. who had also died (see paragraphs 83, 100, 120\u2011131);(c) the allegations against the applicant are based solely on his alleged motive to commit the charged crimes, hearsay evidence and a case brought against Mr P., a former Yukos manager working within its security division;(d) the evidence against the applicant reduces itself to the confessions and belated recollections of convicted prisoners who say in essence that someone told them that someone told that person that the applicant had given instructions for the assaults;(e) the witnesses did not mention the applicant during the original investigations against Mr P. or earlier, they only did so after the Yukos case had begun;(f) the link made between the applicant and Mr P. relied upon a false assertion that the former had had operational control or involvement with the Yukos\u2019s security division so that if Mr P. ordered the charged crimes, the applicant must have ordered him to do this;(g) the case against Mr P. is deeply flawed, his trial was unfair and motivated by improper considerations;(h) the Israeli Ministry of Justice rejected the Russia\u2019s request for the applicant\u2019s extradition due to inadequate and insufficient evidential basis against the applicant (see paragraphs 84-85 above);(i) the Swiss Federal Tribunal also indicated the unreliable nature of the allegations against the applicant (see paragraphs 14 above);(j) the trial evidence against the applicant consisted entirely of indirect, hearsay evidence and unsupported supposition;(k) all the alleged perpetrators of the crimes uniformly testified that they had never met or spoken or corresponded with the applicant;(l) as to the episode, relating to the murder of Ms Ko., the judge did not examine the statement of witness Mr O. that the investigators coerced him to give evidence (see paragraphs 96, 120, 121 and 127 above);(m) as to the episodes, relating to the murder of Mr Pe., robbery of Mr Kol. and the attempted murders of Mr Ry., Mr T. recanted his previous statements, testifying that the investigators promised him reduced sentence if he testified against the applicant (see paragraphs 78, 81, 98, 116, 122-127, 138 above);(n) Mr R. testified that he first heard the applicant\u2019s name from the investigators (see paragraphs 78, 99, 122-127 above).7. Failure to take account of exculpatory evidence and to give reasons for not considering it178. According to the applicant, the evidence presented by the prosecution was no more than assumptions, expressions of a personal opinion or was based on unverified third-party information. In particular, the verdict did not take account of exculpatory evidence on the following accounts:(a) the domestic court wrongly stated that witness Mr P. had not given evidence in court and that all the evidence had been collected in accordance with the domestic law;(b) the court unlawfully excluded as evidence the court decisions of Swiss and Israeli courts (see paragraphs 110 above);(c) the verdict repeated passages from the verdict by which Mr P. was convicted, thus incorporating the evidence of witnesses who appeared at the Mr P.\u2019s trial, but not in the proceedings against the applicant (see paragraph 132 above);(d) as to the episode relating to the murder of Mr Pe., the court judgment wrongly presumed the existence of evidence that Yukos had failed to pay taxes to the local budget (see paragraphs 122-123 above);(e) the court groundlessly considered the statements of witness Ms Ol. untruthful (see paragraph 123 above);(f) as to the episodes relating to the attempted murders of Ms O.K. and Mr Ry., the court failed to address significant contradictions in the statements of the victims (see paragraphs 126 and 127).8. Bias of the judge179. According to the applicant, the trial judge showed bias against the defence by:(a) interfering with cross-examination;(b) assisting witnesses\u2019 \u2018recollections\u2019;(c) failing to examine serious evidential contradictions and inconsistencies by adversarial submissions;(d) on numerous occasions interrupting testimony in order to ensure that witnesses maintained the story consistently with the prosecution\u2019s theory of the case;(e) hectoring the applicant\u2019s chosen defence lawyer during cross\u2011examination;(f) correcting witnesses when their evidence differed from that which supported the prosecution\u2019s assertions;(g) refusing to provide the defence with the time needed to adequately prepare for trial;(h) allowing the trial to continue on the basis of the haphazard attendance of witnesses;(i) allowing statements of witnesses made during the preliminary investigation to be read out by the prosecution subsequent to those witnesses\u2019 examinations, so that the statements could not be tested (see paragraph 115 above);(j) not providing the defence with enough time to prepare the case after the closure of the prosecution\u2019s case and for the closing remarks (see paragraphs 115-118 above);(k) preventing counsel D.Kh. from calling any defence witnesses (see paragraph 110 above);(l) supporting the verdict through extensive reliance on matters never introduced at the trial and incorporated excerpts from the verdict of case against Mr P., not presented at the applicant\u2019s trial;(m) by implying regarding the episode of the murder of Mr Pe. in the course of examination of Mr Kon. on 30 May 2008 that the applicant was guilty because Mr P. had been found guilty in proceedings brought against him (see paragraphs 95 and 129 above);(n) by refusing to adduce evidence of former FSB Operative Mr Li., who had stated that he had personal knowledge that Mr Pe. was killed in an FSB operation (see paragraph 110 above);(o) as to the each of the episodes, relating respectively to the murder of Mr Pe., the robbery of Mr Kol. and the attempted murder of Mr Ry., by dismissing recantation of evidence by Mr T. and Mr R. (see paragraphs 78, 81, 98, 116, 122-127, 138 above).9. Political motivation: differential treatment and the abuse of power180. The applicant complains that the basis for the criminal proceedings against the applicant was not objective and that his prosecution was politically motivated. The applicant was deliberately singled out for differential treatment and the proceedings as a whole involved his victimisation by an abuse of power.He relied on the following alleged circumstances to confirm this complaint:(a) the applicant\u2019s criminal proceedings, undertaken in his absence, were not conducted in order to solve crimes and punish those guilty of them, but were the result of a political goal, namely the Russian authorities\u2019 politically motivated wider persecution of Yukos Oil Company and its key shareholders and management and the destruction of the company itself;(b) the criminal proceedings were part of the state\u2019s large scale corporate conflict over the Yukos case and the expropriation of the company, which resulted in the conviction and imposition of a sentence of imprisonment on the applicant, Mr Kh. and Mr Le., as well as the ultimate destruction of Yukos; in the 2004 Presidential election the applicant was a public and vocal supporter of opposition political parties and candidates, openly putting his financial support behind two liberal parties, \u2018the Union of Right Forces\u2019 and \u2018Yabloko\u2019;(c) the timing of allegations that the applicant had committed personal tax offences coincided with the applicant\u2019s declaration of public support for the presidential campaign of opposition candidate, Ms I.Kh., and her \u2018Free Russia\u2019 party;(d) the decision to indict the applicant on two incidents did not occur until July 4, 2005, the day after the applicant arrived in the United States at the invitation of Congressman Mr T.L. in order to testify about the \u2018Yukos affair\u2019 before the United States Commission for Security and Cooperation in Europe; the initiation of the \u2018Yukos affair\u2019 followed a warning by the President of Russia Mr Pu. that Russian businessmen should stay away from political involvement or they would face the consequences;(e) the object of the attack on Yukos Oil Company and those associated with it, which commenced in 2003, has been to silence the key group of shareholders, including the applicant, and to expropriate the assets of Yukos Oil Company (see paragraphs 2 above);(f) the courts of the UK, Switzerland, Lithuania and Cyprus either refused requests to extradite former Yukos employees to Russia or refused mutual legal assistance on the ground that the criminal proceedings were politically motivated. Political motivated were also echoed by the conclusions of the reports of PACE, other organisations and NGOs (see paragraph 15 above)..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Ms Marina Anatolyevna Samoylova, is a Russian national, who was born in 1961 and lives in Moscow.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.The applicant\u2019s husband was a prosecutor in Moscow and retired in 2006. Subsequently, he was charged with a number of criminal offences and stood trial (see also Valeriy Samoylov v. Russia, no. 57541/09, 24 January 2012). The applicant was not accused of or charged with any criminal offence in relation to these criminal proceedings.In August 2009 the case against Mr Samoylov was submitted for trial.On 10 September 2009 Channel One, a nationwide television station, broadcasted a popular TV-programme Chelovek I Zakon. This programme contained a reportage relating to the ongoing trial against Mr Samoylov. Prior to the broadcasting of the reportage, the journalists had collected, from an unspecified source or unspecified sources, certain information concerning the applicant (her home address, her tax-payer identification number, her income, her estate), as well as a video recording and photographs showing the interior of her residence. The applicant did not give consent to the processing of this information, including its collection, disclosure and dissemination.According to the applicant, following the disclosure of her home address, she was harassed by numerous journalists at her place of residence.Considering that various aspects of the above reportage encroached upon the inviolability of their home, private and family life, as well as their honour and dignity, the applicant and her husband brought civil proceedings.The applicant referred to the following aspects:- the programme showed a document, which was presented as the applicant\u2019s income certificate. In addition to the annual income data for 2004-2007, it indicated the applicant\u2019s full name, her home address and her official tax-payer identification number. She had not given any consent to the dissemination of the above information.- The annual income data was false. It was much lower that the applicant\u2019s actual income, which, being presented together with the \u2011 inaccurate - indication that her house costs 2,000,000 US dollars, implied that the applicant had received income from doubtful sources.- A video and photographs of the interior of her residence were shown during the TV-programme. It appeared that the TV journalist had made the recordings when allowed by the investigating officer.By judgment of 18 May 2010 the Ostankinskiy District Court of Moscow dismissed her claims. The court\u2019s findings may be summarised as follows:- A prosecutor\u2019s stature requires strict compliance with the requirement of law and implies transparency of his income and expenditure. This is especially important on account of the then and ongoing anti-corruption campaigns. The journalist\u2019s indication of the residence\u2019s cost of USD 2,000,000 and presentation of the claimants\u2019 income certificates, taken together, amounted to an admissible exaggeration aimed at showing the disparity between the claimants\u2019 income and the luxurious residence they owned. The claimants\u2019 actual income and the residence\u2019s cost are immaterial in the above circumstances.- The certificate was obtained by lawful means and disclosure of the income information without the claimants\u2019 consent pursued the legitimate interest of informing the public about the income received both by the former official and his family members.- The video shown in the TV-programme was obtained lawfully with the investigator\u2019s permission.- Referring to Article 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the court stated that the income certificate and video recordings were pieces of evidence in the criminal case and thus could not be obtained by the journalist otherwise than following the investigator\u2019s permission. It was open to the journalist to give his own assessment of this evidence; the veracity of such information could not be reviewed by the court in this civil case.The applicant appealed, arguing, inter alia, as follows:- the first-instance court failed assess her claim relating to the respondent\u2019s collection and dissemination of such information as the applicant\u2019s full name, her home address and the fact of the ongoing criminal prosecution against her husband.- the court provided no legal basis for its conclusion that the respondent had lawfully obtained the information contained in the income certificate.On 20 December 2010 the Moscow City Court upheld the judgment. It stated that while the claimants did prove the dissemination of information tarnishing their honour and dignity (\u0440\u0430\u0441\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0449\u0438\u0445 \u0441\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0439), this information \u201ccorresponded to reality\u201d (\u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043b\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438).According to the applicant, the information concerning her name, home address and alike remained available on the website of the TV-programme.B. Relevant domestic law and practice1. Russian ConstitutionArticle 23 of the Constitution protects inviolability of one\u2019s private life, honour and good name.Article 24 of the Russian Constitution prohibits collection, storage, use or dissemination of information about one\u2019s private life, with his or her consent.Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees inviolability of one\u2019s home. None should be permitted to enter one\u2019s home despite the will of its residents, except in the cases prescribed by a federal law or by a court order.2. Mass Media Act of 27 December 1991Section 49 of the Act provides that a journalist is legally required to seek consent of the interested person for disseminating information relating to this person\u2019s private life, except when \u201cit is necessary for protecting public interests\u201d.3. Personal Data Act of 27 July 2006Section 3 of the Act defines \u201cpersonal data\u201d as any information directly or directly identifying a specific person.A journalist can process such data, without the person\u2019s consent, for the purposes of his professional activities and/or lawful activities of the mass media, provided that such processing does not violate the person\u2019s rights (section 6 of the Act).According to the Supreme Court of Russia, a tax-payer identification number does not contain information of a personal nature, relating to one\u2019s family situation or relationships, and thus does not fall within the scope of protection of the inviolability of private life (decision no. GKPIOO-402 of 30 May 2000).4. Code of Criminal ProcedureArticle 161 of the Code provides that an investigator may authorise disclosure of the \u201cinformation\u201d relating to the preliminary investigation of a criminal case, if such disclosure does not impinge upon the investigation and does not violate the rights or legitimate interests of the persons involved in the investigation. The investigator should determine the scope of disclosure.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention that the domestic courts failed to deal with a part of her claims regarding collection and dissemination of information concerning her family and private life, such as her full name and home address; dissemination of the video and photographs showing the interior of her residence.The applicant complains under Article 8 of the Convention about unlawful collection, unlawful and disproportionate disclosure of the following data and information, including the following:The applicant also alleges that the State officials directly provided or assisted the journalist in obtaining this information and data.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Mr Rasul Jafarov, is an Azerbaijani national, who was born in 1984 and lives in Baku. He is represented before the Court by Mr K. Bagirov and Mr R. Remezaite, lawyers practising, respectively, in Azerbaijan and London.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.A. Institution of criminal proceedings against the applicant and his remand in custodyThe applicant is a well-known civil society activist and human rights defender. He is the chairman and one of the co-founders of Human Rights Club (\u201cthe Association\u201d), a non-governmental organisation specialised in protection of human rights. The applicant participated in the preparation of various reports relating to human rights issues in Azerbaijan.The applicant also coordinated the Sing for Democracy campaign during the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku which aimed at drawing attention to human rights violations in Azerbaijan. He is also a member of the Board of Directors of the Republican Alternative Civic Movement.On an unspecified date in May 2014 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office instituted criminal proceedings under Articles 308.1 (abuse of power) and 313 (forgery by an official) of the Criminal Code in connection with alleged irregularities in the financial activities of a number of non-governmental organisations.When the applicant was in Kyiv from 6 to 11 July 2014, he learned that by a decision of 7 July 2014 the Sabail District Court ordered a freezing injunction in respect of his bank accounts.On 29 July 2014, while travelling by train from Baku to Tbilisi, the applicant was stopped during border control at the Azerbaijani-Georgian border. He was informed that he could not leave the country because a travel ban had been imposed on him.On 30 July 2014 the applicant was invited to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office where he was questioned as a witness in connection with the above-mentioned criminal proceedings.On 2 August 2014 the applicant was again invited to the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office for questioning as a witness. According to the applicant, on 2 August 2014, on his arrival at the premises of the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office, he was arrested and was charged under Articles 192.2.2 (illegal entrepreneurship), 213.1 (large-scale tax evasion) and 308.2 (abuse of power) of the Criminal Code.On the same day the Nasimi District Court, relying on the official charges brought against the applicant and the prosecutor\u2019s request for the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody, ordered the applicant\u2019s detention for a period of three months. The court justified the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody by the gravity of the charges and the likelihood that if released the applicant might abscond from or obstruct the investigation.Before and after the applicant\u2019s arrest, numerous articles about the applicant were published in the State media and in the media allegedly close to the Government. In these articles, he was described as \u201ca spy of foreign countries\u201d and \u201ca traitor\u201d. Moreover, a number of politicians from the ruling political party made pejorative comments about recently arrested NGO activists in Azerbaijan, without quoting specifically the applicant\u2019s name.On 4 August 2014 the Prosecutor General\u2019s Office made a public statement in which it was noted that the applicant was charged under Articles 192.2.2, 213.1 and 308.2 of the Criminal Code because there was a suspicion that he had committed crimes provided for in the above-mentioned articles.On 5 August 2014 the applicant appealed against the Nasimi District Court\u2019s decision of 2 August 2014, claiming that his detention was unlawful. He submitted, in particular, that the court had failed to justify the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody and that there was no risk of his absconding from or obstructing the investigation.On 8 August 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal, finding that the first-instance court\u2019s decision was lawful.B. The applicant\u2019s request for release on bail or replacement of his pre-trial detention by house arrestOn 19 August 2014 the applicant lodged a request with the Nasimi District Court asking the court to release him on bail or to place him under house arrest in lieu of being remanded in custody. He argued in this connection that there was no reason justifying his continued detention.On 20 August 2014 the Nasimi District Court dismissed the request, finding that there was no need to change the preventive measure of remand in custody.On 28 August 2014 the Baku Court of Appeal upheld the first-instance court\u2019s decision.COMPLAINTS1. The applicant complains under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that his arrest and detention were unlawful because there was no reasonable suspicion that he had committed a criminal offence.2. The applicant complains under Article 5 \u00a7 3 of the Convention that the domestic courts failed to justify the application of the preventive measure of remand in custody in his respect and that there were no relevant and sufficient reasons for his continued detention.[A1]3. The applicant complains under Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention that the domestic courts did not address his specific arguments in support of his release.4. The applicant complains under Articles 11 and 18 of the Convention that his right to freedom of association was violated because his arrest and detention were intended to silence him as an NGO activist. He further complains that his Convention rights were restricted for purposes other than those prescribed in the Convention. In particular, he argues that his arrest and pre-trial detention were intended to silence him as an NGO activist and human rights defender.[A2].\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

He is represented before the Court by Ms V. Dren\u0161ki Lasan, a lawyer practising in Zagreb.The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.On 14 April 2005 K.M.J., a basketball player in the Gospi\u0107 Women\u2019s Basketball Club, reported to the police that the applicant had sexually assaulted her.The applicant was arrested on the same day on suspicion of rape.On 15 April 2005 the local police department gave a detailed statement to the media concerning the incident, in which they disclosed the personal details and identity of the victim. This subsequently gave rise to an action by K.M.J. for damages against the State.On 30 June 2005 the applicant was indicted in the Gospi\u0107 County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Gospi\u0107u) on charges of rape.The proceedings before the Gospi\u0107 County Court were closed to the public, in order to protect the private life of both the victim and the accused.On 1 December 2005 the Gospi\u0107 County Court acquitted the applicant, but the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske) quashed the judgment and remitted the case for retrial upon an appeal by the relevant State Attorney\u2019s Office.In the resumed proceedings, the case was transferred to the Rijeka County Court (\u017dupanijski sud u Rijeci).At a hearing on 13 September 2007, the applicant requested that the proceedings be heard in open court. He argued that representatives of the OSCE (Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe) had been present at the hearing before the Supreme Court, and that the victim had given numerous statements to the media concerning the case. He therefore considered that the proceedings should be heard in open court so that people could obtain an independent picture of the case.The trial court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request for the proceedings to be heard in open court, on the grounds that it was necessary to protect the victim\u2019s private life.At a hearing on 3 December 2007 the applicant reiterated his request for the proceedings to be heard in open court. He pointed out that, in the meantime, K.M.J. had given four interviews to the media in which she had provided various details about her private life and the incident in issue. In particular, K.M.J. had given an interview on 8 January 2006 to Jutarnji list (a daily newspaper with national circulation) in which she had disclosed details about her private life and part of the statement which she had given to the investigating judge.The trial court dismissed the applicant\u2019s request as ill-founded.At a hearing on 4 December 2007, K.M.J. gave evidence before the trial court.On 5 December 2007 a daily newspaper with national circulation (Novi list) published an article in which K.M.J. and her lawyer gave statements about her examination as a witness on 4 December 2007.On 21 January 2008 the applicant complained to the trial court about K.M.J.\u2019s breach of confidentiality with regard to the proceedings.Meanwhile, on 13 November 2007 the newspaper Jutarnji list published another exclusive interview with K.M.J. about the manner in which the case had affected her private life.On 7 February 2008 the Rijeka County Court found the applicant guilty of rape and sentenced him to three years\u2019 imprisonment. The delivery of the judgment was public and was covered by the national television channel (HRT), as well as two private television channels with national coverage (RTL and Nova TV).The applicant challenged that judgment before the Supreme Court (Vrhovni sud Republike Hrvatske), complaining, inter alia, that the proceedings had been unjustifiably closed to the public.On 8 June 2009 the Supreme Court, following a hearing which was closed to the public, dismissed the applicant\u2019s appeal and upheld his conviction, sentencing him to two years\u2019 imprisonment. The Supreme Court held that, in view of the nature of the charges against the applicant, the exclusion of the public from the case had been justified.The applicant then challenged these findings before the Constitutional Court (Ustavni sud Republike Hrvatske), and on 8 November 2012 the Constitutional Court dismissed his constitutional complaint as ill-founded, endorsing the judgment of the Supreme Court.The decision of the Constitutional Court was served on the applicant\u2019s representative on 22 November 2012.COMPLAINTThe applicant complains under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention about the exclusion of the public from the criminal proceedings against him in relation to the charges of rape..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

He is represented before the Court by Mr E. Ludvigsen, a lawyer practising in T\u00f8nsberg.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.1. General backgroundAfter the adoption of the 1958 Convention on the Continental Shelf, the Norwegian Government proclaimed in a Royal Decree of 31 May 1963 Norwegian sovereignty over the seafloor and the ground beneath the seafloor outside Norway. This was followed up with the 1963 Act on the Exploration and Exploitation of Sub-Sea Natural Resources (kontinentalsokkelloven). Drilling in the North Sea area started in June 1966. In this connection diving operations were carried out in part in sheltered waters from barges and smaller boats, for example in relation to the construction and equipment of drilling platforms, in part in the open sea. During the first years the depths involved were not particularly great. At the Ekofisk Oil Field the sea was approximately seventy metres deep, at the Statfjord Oil Field it was approximately 150 metres. To begin with diving took place from oil rigs, supply ships, drilling ships or pipe-laying ships. From the mid-1970s specially built diving support vessels, operational regardless of weather conditions, were used and, after a while, became the usual means.For dives down to 50 metres, air gas was used and decompression took place either in the water or at the surface.For professional North Sea diving, deep and relatively short diving jobs (rarely more than 1 hour) were described as bounce diving. This was normally performed with a diving bell and a surface decompression chamber. Two divers would access the diving bell at the surface under regular atmospheric pressure. The diving bell would be lowered into the water and down to the work location at the seabed. When the diving bell was located at the work location and the necessary tools had been lowered, the diving bell would be put under the same pressure as the work location, normally within minutes. The diver could leave the diving bell and do the job.Both the diving bell and the diver would be supplied with gas from tanks attached to the diving bell (normally heliox). One of the divers would perform the job while the other would serve as a combined \u201ctender\u201d and stand by diver in the event that something went wrong. When the job had been completed the diver would return to the diving bell. Then, the diving bell would be lifted to the surface and connected to a decompression chamber, where the divers would complete their decompression. Heliox would normally be replaced by air when the diving bell pressure was similar to a water pressure at fifty metres. Generally, bounce diving was perceived as stressful because divers had little time to do the job on the seabed and felt thermal uneasiness (first the increased temperature when the diving bell was put under pressure and then hypothermia when entering the water which was five to seven degrees Celsius).North Sea dives of longer duration were performed as saturation diving. The divers entered chambers at the surface (on the rig or on the diving support vessel) and were put under a pressure similar to that which existed on the seabed work location. Then the chambers were connected to a diving bell. Two divers would leave the chamber in order to enter the diving bell, which would be lowered to the work location. The divers and the diving bell would be supplied by gas from the surface. The divers would normally wear warm water suits supplied with warm water from the surface. It normally took several hours from when the diving bell left the chamber at the surface until it was reconnected. Subsequently, the divers were locked back into the chamber. This way of diving ensured continuous work on the seabed, while the divers could rest, sleep and eat in a chamber. After a period of work of several days or weeks, the divers were decompressed.Until 1 April 1978 the Norwegian Labour Inspection Authority (Arbedistilsynet) was the public authority empowered and entrusted with the task of administrative supervision of diving operations and the granting of authorisation for such operations. Thereafter these functions were vested in the Petroleum Directorate (Oljedirektoratet).The applicant was one of the between 350 and 400 persons who were permanently linked to Norway and who took part in diving related to the petroleum industry during the pioneer period (commonly defined as 1965 to 1990). After a while it became known that many of them had contracted health problems. Long term studies carried out at the University of Bergen, the Norwegian Underwater Technology Centre and Haukeland Hospital showed possible connections between diving and injuries to the central nervous system. As it transpired that available compensation arrangements only to a limited degree covered the North Sea divers\u2019 situation, the Ministry of Municipal Affairs appointed a commission (Kronbergutvalget) which on 2 November 1993 submitted a report with recommendations. It was left to another commission (Habberstadutvlaget) to follow-up and coordinate their implementation.On 27 November 2000 the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health proposed in a note to Parliament that divers who had experienced permanent health injuries should be accorded an amount of up to NOK 200,000 in lump sum compensation, whilst emphasising that the State could not be regarded as having acted unlawfully or in a manner open to criticism, bearing in mind what was known at the time when the diving had taken place. On 13 June 2000 Parliament requested the Government to set up an independent inquiry commission to assess all matters related to diving in connection with the oil activities in the North Sea during the pioneer period. The Commission of Inquiry, which the Government had appointed on 2 March 2001, was led by High Court Justice Mr P.A. Lossius. On 31 December 2002 it presented its report entitled \u201cThe Pioneer Divers in the North Sea\u201d (Pionerdykkerne i Nordsj\u00f8en), Norges Offentlige Utredninger (\u201cNOU\u201d Official Norwegian Report) 2003:5. An English summary of the report included inter alia the following observations:\u201c7.7.4 Assessments and conclusions after the surveyAlthough the Commission of Inquiry could have hoped for a better basis for their assessments of the pioneer divers\u2019 state of health, it considers that the data obtained permit a qualitatively useful description of the situation. What is most striking is the wide variation: many subjects have managed well, indeed some very well, while a not insignificant share are struggling with serious medical problems.However, a large number, about three out of four, have experienced diving accidents or diving disorders. More than half have suffered decompression sickness, many of them a number of times. The fact that one in five divers has lost consciousness during dives is very serious. This can trigger post-traumatic stress syndrome in genetically predisposed individuals.A disturbingly large number of divers are on disability pension. The fact that relatively young people, aged around 40, are affected is especially significant. This, together with the relatively large number with mental disorders, suggests that many divers have had to deal with heavier stress than most people encounter in the ordinary world of work.In common with findings on the British side, the number of suicides among divers on the Norwegian shelf is disturbingly high. As in the case of other suicides, it is difficult to comment on causes. However, it is not inconceivable that the long-lasting and heavy pressure that divers had to endure may have been a significant factor in the process.When assessing the state of health of North Sea divers it is important to remember that many of them started out as a specially selected and well-trained group of young men. After an average of about 14 years in the North Sea, the majority are in a satisfactory state of health based on the information they have supplied. However, a relatively high proportion have acquired appreciable health problems, illustrated by the fact that almost one-fifth are disabled, and that a number of divers complain of concentration, memory and hearing impairments. The same symptoms are documented in Norwegian and foreign investigations alike. It seems probable that the extreme stress to which many North Sea divers have been exposed at work has been a significant factor behind the disorders that a number of them have developed.[...]7.8 Liability issues7.8.1 Liability for damages under Norwegian lawUnder Norwegian law liability for damages may be imposed with a basis in the non-statutory concept of negligence or with a basis in strict liability. The main idea behind strict liability is that the risk entailed by an activity should be borne by the party in whose interest the tortious act is committed. Strict liability is grounded in a balancing of interests where the issue is who is closest in terms of bearing the risk. There are no clear-cut dividing lines between negligent and strict liability.In addition to the basis for liability (negligent or strict), there must be an adequate causal relationship and a financial loss.7.8.2 Liability for damages on the part of the Norwegian StateWhen considering the Norwegian State\u2019s liability it is expedient to take a basis in strict liability. Through the State\u2019s declaration of its sovereignty over the Norwegian continental shelf, the State has acquired a limited ownership position over the shelf with proprietary rights to the subsea petroleum deposits and exclusive rights to resource management. By virtue of its ownership the State has overarching responsibility for activities on the Norwegian continental shelf.The State, as sovereign authority, also has the power to make laws and collect taxes in respect of activities on the shelf.When the Norwegian State by virtue of owning the Norwegian continental shelf chose to start production of oil and gas resources on the shelf, it did so by issuing licences to private actors who operate the activity for their own account, but at the same time undertake to leave a portion of the oil and gas resources free-of-charge to the State. The Commission does not investigate the relatively difficult questions of private and public law that bear on the State\u2019s position on the continental shelf. Suffice it to say that at all events the State earns substantial revenues on the shelf activities. This is the \u00abdirect State involvement in the petroleum industry\u00bb, which is attended to by the State-owned company Petoro.The State\u2019s substantial revenues must be viewed in light of the substantial risk of damage and injury that shelf activities entail, and that accidents can readily assume large-scale proportions. There are grounds for asserting that since the State has initiated activity on the shelf that entails a constant risk of damage and injury, it is reasonable to expect the State to contribute to bearing the financial liability for damages and injury arising out of the oil activity. As owner of the petroleum resources, the State is usually closer in terms of bearing this liability than is the individual injured party.Hence the notion of risk distribution that underlies strict liability suggests that to some extent the State has a strict liability for aspects of the activity on the shelf. Any demarcation of the State\u2019s liability in relation to the North Sea divers, who have had central and important tasks in connection with oil production, cannot be deemed necessary.In the Commission\u2019s view considerable emphasis must, when assessing the State\u2019s liability, be given to the fact that the State\u2019s position as owner means that the State has a certain duty to ensure that activities on the shelf are operated in a proper manner. Moreover, responsibility for basic safety in the field of worker protection rests with the State.From the foregoing review of the Labour Inspection\u2019s role up to 1978, it is clear that in the view of the Commission the lack of supervision resulted in greater burdens being imposed on divers than on most other categories of employees. The virtual absence of rules and appropriate diver training also contributed. These factors were familiar to the State administration for several years without being remedied.A further factor is that in the following period, when jurisdictional and ministerial conflicts were in progress, the authorities cannot have focused fully on safety work in the North Sea. The Commission finds it probable that the safety effort was delayed. It is probable that also this too contributed to divers being exposed to greater occupational stress than other categories of employees.The fact that complete knowledge of the injuries that diving could entail was lacking, and that opinions on the injury situation are divided, cannot be regarded as decisive.The Commission believes that a link exists between some divers\u2019 workload and their present health situation.All in all, there is in the Commission\u2019s view much to suggest that the State has a legal liability and should therefore bear the financial liability for injuries sustained by divers as a result of diving in the North Sea and for disorders that may develop (late effects).7.8.3 Liability for damages on the part of other playersAny liability on the part of the diving companies would seem to be primarily justified in terms of negligence, although, here too, there are arguments in favour of strict liability. The key point when assessing liability is the divers\u2019 workload in the broad sense combined with their fear of being sent onshore, along with the prevailing work ethos according to which decompression sickness with the necessary treatment was acceptable. Reference is also made to the fact that decompression tables were an element in the competition among the companies.The particular factors associated with the licensee/operator\u2019s controlling position and financial interest in the activity could suggest that they should be held liable on a strict basis irrespective of whether a basis for liability rests with the diving company or not. The observations on risk distribution that justify strict liability for the State also apply in the main in relation to the licensee/operator.What in the Commission\u2019s view specifically justifies legal liability for the operator/licensee is the divers\u2019 workload coupled with their fear of being sent onshore and the emphasis on speed during diving operations. A further element is the fact that the work ethos prevailing in much of the period investigated by the Commission accepted decompression sickness with ensuing treatment (recompression) as part and parcel of diving. This is assumed to have been familiar to licensees/operators too. All in all there is reason to believe that these factors have contributed to the injuries sustained by a number of divers.In general the injured parties\u2019 own circumstances carry little weight in employment relationships and in the Commission\u2019s view cannot be assigned importance in light of the health situation of many North Sea divers.7.8.4 RecommendationsThe Commission of Inquiry recommends the establishment of a scheme under the following guidelines in respect of North Sea divers with disorders:Compensation should be granted for financial lossThe scheme should be established and funded by the StateLicensees/operators should be invited to participate in such funding.\u201dThe Commission\u2019s report was sent for comment to the different institutions and organisations concerned. The legislation department of the Ministry of Justice expressed the view that the State did not have a sufficient connection to the oil activity for it to be liable on the ground of strict liability and that employers\u2019 liability for the State was difficult to envisage, a matter to be considered by the Ministry of Employment and Administration. After the latter had expressed its views the Government expressed in a note to Parliament that the pioneer divers who had done ground breaking work in the North Sea from 1965 to 1990, should receive the compensation for non-pecuniary and pecuniary damage they deserved. Although the State was not liable from a legal point of view, the Government considered that it had a particular moral and political duty vis-\u00e0-vis the divers. It proposed that a special compensation scheme be put in place to be administered by a board.After parliamentary approval the Government, by a Royal Decree of 4 June 2004, set up a board empowered to deal with compensation claims from divers under a State-budget financed scheme. The payments were to be adjusted in accordance with the person\u2019s disability degree according to the assessment made by the social security authorities in their decision on disability compensation and to be linked to the latter\u2019s basis amount (grunnbel\u00f8p \u2013 \u201cG\u201d), with 40G or approximately NOK 2,300,000 (EUR 292,000) being the maximum. In addition, divers were granted NOK 200,000 (EUR 25,000) in compensation for non-pecuniary damage.Pending disbursements under the above scheme, by a Royal Decree of 27 June 2003, it was decided to take emergency measures to compensate divers who were in a precarious financial situation. According to an individual assessment, they could thus be granted amounts of up to NOK 200,000 (deductible from any award made under the scheme mentioned above). This ceiling was later raised to NOK 300,000.In addition to the above, there existed two further compensation schemes. One, adopted by Parliament on 13 June 2000 (when it had requested the Government to appoint the Commission of Inquiry) and in effect since 1 July 2000, which had consisted of lump sum payments in amounts of up to NOK 200,000 to divers who were receiving a disability pension and who had a disability degree of 50% or more.Another had been set up by Statoil on 1 November 2001, under which divers could apply for compensation regardless of whether they had been employed by the company. Under the latter, amounts of up to NOK 750,000 (EUR 95,000) could be granted.2. The factual circumstances underlying the applicant\u2019s complaintsFrom the age of sixteen the applicant worked as a seaman for periods, pursued studies in mechanics and underwent secondary education and served as a marine soldier in the army for a period until 1974. During the latter he carried out diving. From 20 May 1975 to 9 September 1975 the applicant was employed by the diving company ThreeX Diving LTd., where he first worked as a diver and then as a diving team leader. Thereafter, he pursued further education in Switzerland. For a period, he took on diving jobs in parallel to studying.(i) Incidents at Arctic SurveyorFrom early 1976 until 27 June 1978 the applicant was employed by Deep Sea Diving and was assigned to carry out work for the diving company Scan Dive AS. He worked off shore on board the diving vessel Arctic Surveyor (\u201cthe Arctic Surveyor\u201d) at the Ekofisk Oil Field in the North Sea. The diving was carried out at approximately a depth of seventy-five metres. The work consisted amongst other things of installing and repairing transport structures through the Ekofisk Oil Field to Teeside in England and Emden in Germany.The applicant submitted that during this period he had been exposed to several incidents in diving operations endangering his life and health. For instance, in 1977 he had been exposed to serious spinal decompression sickness owing to an excessively rapid decompression. This had most probably been the cause of his permanent brain and spinal injuries.The applicant had further experienced that the umbilical supplying him with breathing gas and several other necessities had been pinned under a cement block weighing several tons that had been lowered from the sea surface. He had also experienced being pulled by the umbilical as the vessel had moved in a drift. The applicant was not injured but, he pointed out, such drift had been particularly dangerous because of the presence of a number of installations and devices on the seafloor in which he could have been caught up or which could have led to the umbilical being torn off and, probably, death.The applicant had also experienced the gas being cut off at a depth of seventy metres. In a diving operation in 1976 Arctic Surveyor had been damaged in a hurricane while he and other divers had been undergoing saturation. The applicant and the other divers had had no possibility of leaving the vessel and had had to remain in the saturation chamber while the ship was taken to shore for repairs and had returned to the stormy sea so that work could continue.While assigned to the Arctic Surveyor, the applicant performed bounce diving and saturation diving. He spent altogether 200 days doing saturation diving, which lasted nineteen days and nights on average, twenty-six days and nights at the most.On 27 June 1978, after a conflict with his superior, the applicant was dismissed from his job with Scan Dive AS.From March 1979 to October 1981 the applicant worked with a Danish company Tage Nielsen & Co. K/S on a project aimed at developing particular foam for use in rescue operations. Until 1983 he took part in a number of other projects.(ii) Incidents at Tender CometIn 1983 the applicant was employed by the diving company Wharton Williams Taylor(2W), which had been hired by the then Mobil Oil to carry out diving operations inter alia in connection with repairs of a buoy at the Statfjord Oil Field on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. The diving operations were carried out from the diving vessel Tender Comet (\u201cthe Tender Comet\u201d) down as far as a depth of one hundred and eighty metres.During the period from 10 to 29 June 1983 the applicant had taken part in a saturation dive which had been planned to last for approximately two weeks. The dive had been shorter than planned as the applicant had experienced a very serious breach of the safety requirements pertaining to divers and had chosen to discontinue the dive. He had amongst other things suffered from earache and severe pain during decompression. He submitted that the diving from the Tender Comet had been conducted with tables, routines and equipment that had been dangerous and harmful to him. It had caused him suffer Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (\u201cPTSD\u201d) and buzzing in the ears.A few days before the applicant had boarded the Tender Comet, the Petroleum Directorate had taken part in an inspection on board the vessel, formally as an observer of the diving company\u2019s internal quality control. The medical logbook had indicated that a number of incidents of sores and infections had occurred, that seven persons had had earache or infection in their ears (one of which could have been due to the overuse of tablets), that one person had had eye problems, that two persons had turned ill in the diving bell and had had to interrupt the diving and four instances of decompression sickness involving two persons.According to the applicant, the humidity inside the decompression chamber had been at a stable level of 90 to 100%; communication between the diving bell and the diving vessel had been deficient so as to make it impossible for divers to obtain contact when communication took place between a diver and the diving bell. He had thus risked not being heard in the event of a crisis, at a depth of 180 metres.The diving bell had also had shortcomings. For example the spring lifting the door at the bottom of the bell had been broken so that divers had had to lift the door by their own effort.The decompression had not stopped during night hours while divers were asleep, thereby increasing the risk of bubbles accumulating in the absence of any movement in their joints. This had led to unnecessary and considerable pain. In addition, the applicant had suffered earache during the dive, making decompression even more painful.The Norwegian authorities had approved the diving operation and had granted a dispensation with regard to the maximum length of the umbilical and the saturation time.The applicant complained to the Petroleum Directorate and filed complaints with the police on 17 October 1983 against the diving company. In response, the Petroleum Directorate carried out an inspection on board the Tender Comet, which revealed several shortcomings regarding divers\u2019 safety.Moreover, the police interviewed several divers of the Tender Comet. In February 1984 the police communicated the matter to the Petroleum Directorate, which in May 1984 asked the police to carry out further interviews. After having done so, the police again communicated the case for comment to the Petroleum Directorate, which on 26 March 1985 made a statement to the police. In May 1985 the police proposed to the State Prosecutor to drop the case on the ground that it was time-barred. On 18 September 1985 the police telephoned the applicant and informed him that the case was time-barred.The applicant complained to the State Prosecutor of Rogaland and to the Petroleum Directorate about their handling of his police complaint of 1983 which as a result of having been sent back and forth between them had become time-barred. This led to an internal inquiry in the Directorate and an inquiry report, and subsequent criticism of the report expressed by an officer of the Directorate.After the above-mentioned dive at Tender Comet the applicant finished his career as a diver. From 1984 to 1986 he was employed at the State Diving School and then decided to terminate his employment after a disagreement with the management. From 1988 until 1 June 1989 the applicant was employed at Borregaard Engineering AS. From 1990 onwards he was employed by his own limited liability company and did various jobs. The applicant has not worked since 2000.(iii) Decompression tablesAccording to the applicant, the State had omitted to harmonise decompression tables and/or to require that treatment be provided by medical doctors on-the-spot. Despite the fact that the State clearly ought to have known that divers were routinely subjected to serious decompression sickness during diving operations, it had not ensured nor set requirements that a safe and adequate medical apparatus be present to treat and examine divers before, during or after treatment for decompression sickness. Whilst incidents of decompression sickness had been acute, divers could only obtain access to medical assistance onshore.The treatment of decompression sickness had in itself been risky. When divers had not received adequate treatment, the consequences could be fatal. At an early stage it had become clear that if not treated in an appropriate manner decompression sickness could lead to brain damage and serious damage to the nervous system. Even it treated correctly the illness could lead to brain damage and injury to the nervous system. Although the State had been aware or ought to have been aware of this, it had omitted to ensure that medical doctors and personnel with sufficient expertise were present. The divers had been treating themselves according to their own tables. There had been no medical control of whether the treatment had been appropriate or successful.In addition to being exposed to danger of loss of life or permanent injuries due to decompression according to excessively rapid tables, the divers had been exposed to a danger to their lives and risk of permanent damage due to the absence of medical personnel during critical treatment of decompression sickness.According to the applicant, appropriate medical coverage had not been available before the State had authorised diving operations.It had been this combination of excessively rapid decompression tables and the absence of medical assistance that most probably had caused, in whole or in part, the applicant\u2019s brain damage and spinal injury in 1977.The State had been aware that the rapid decompression tables had been a central factor in competition between diving companies, a factor that the State could have eliminated already during the pioneer period by requiring inter alia the standardising of tables and/or the setting of conditions in connection with the approval of individual diving operations.According to information provided by diving companies, decompression sickness occurred at a rate of 5%. It followed that a diver would contract the illness after every twentieth decompression. If on average four divers took part in every diving operation, decompression would occur every fifth operation. Accordingly, most divers would contract the illness in the course of their career.Decompression sickness had been practically eradicated in 1990 after the introduction, on the initiative of diving companies, of standard requirements for diving tables. All the companies had been positive. As a consequence, diving tables had no longer been a competitive factor.(iv) Requirements to professional qualifications, equipment and practices in granting dispensationUnlike workers employed by industrial building- and construction companies operating onshore, there had been no requirements regarding the professional qualifications of divers operating in the North Sea. The diving companies had been free to recruit whoever they wanted, the only condition being that they had a medical certificate. By omitting to introduce qualification requirements the State had put divers\u2019, including the applicant\u2019s, lives in danger and had exposed them to unnecessary and avoidable additional risk. There had been no reason for not setting requirements as to professional qualifications for offshore work, where the risks had been many times higher than onshore. There been no eligibility requirements for the recruitment of leaders of diving teams. According to the applicant, the State had been aware of the need to impose craft certificate requirements for the same types of activities offshore as onshore. There had been no specific requirements pertaining to diving procedures as such or to chamber operators or diving leaders, as a condition for prior authorisation or to the equipment to be used in diving operations.A combination of deficient diving qualifications, unsuitable or poorly adapted equipment had increased the risk for divers\u2019 lives and the danger of permanent personal injury.The risk had also been increased by dispensations being granted routinely.Pursuant to the 1978 safety regulation, the saturation period for saturation diving should not exceed 16 days. However, the Petroleum Directorate could authorise an extension of the period to twenty-four days and, exceptionally, to thirty-two days, provided it had been agreed between the diving companies and the divers\u2019 representatives. Such dispensation arrangements had their background in the fact that certain operations took more than sixteen days and that avoiding sending in a second team permitted a reduction in certain risks.The safety regulation further provided that diving from a diving bell was not permitted if the divers\u2019 umbilical was longer than twenty-nine metres and that the umbilical of the diver remaining in the bell should not exceed thirty-one metres. This made it possible to reduce the risk of the diving vessel and the diving bell getting too close to the oil platform.In both respects, the Directorate practiced a liberal policy in granting dispensations.It would have been possible to address the above, for instance by legislative or administrative measures, including in administrative orders or the setting of conditions for the grant of administrative authorisations or dispensations or by means of public supervision of the implementation of relevant requirements.3. Particulars regarding the applicant\u2019s disabilityThe applicant was one of several divers who were examined by Haukeland University Hospital in August 2002. According to a specialist statement of 20 February 2004 from the department of professional medicines, the applicant suffered from a \u201cpathological SER\u201d potentially related to his feeling of laziness in his left leg after spinal bends in 1977. His medical invalidity resulting from slight encephalopathy was assessed at 20%. Buzzing in the ear and reduced hearing had entailed a 5 % reduction. His other neurological symptoms were so unspecific that they could not be verified. An eventual PTSD had to be the subject of another assessment.According to a psychiatrist\u2019s statement of 10 June 2004 the applicant clearly suffered from work injury, physically and psychologically. He had a delayed development of PTSD becoming more and more apparent and present. His condition had been chronic and was difficult to treat in way other than the applicant adapting himself to his own capacities. Since his condition was unstable it was difficult for him to plan and he could not therefore occupy an ordinary job where he had to fulfil conditions and meet expectations. He needed flexibility. He needed to use his remaining capacities for himself in order to manage the exigencies of daily life. His psychological incapacity was assessed at 34%.On 16 August 2005 the Social Security Office granted the applicant work injury benefits considering that his injury dated back to 1 January 1985. On an appeal by the applicant, the Social Security Court (trygderetten) maintained the latter date by a judgment of 7 July 2006. It held that his medical invalidity amounted to 40%, covering a low degree of encephalopathy, reduced hearing, buzzing in the ear and PTSD.Under the various compensation schemes described under sub-title \u201c1\u201d above the applicant received various sums totalling NOK 3,600,000 (EUR 462,700) in compensation.4. Proceedings before the City CourtOn 25 February 2005 the applicant instituted proceedings against the State before the Oslo City Court (tingrett), claiming additional compensation on the grounds of negligence (subjektivt erstatningsansvar), violations of Norway\u2019s obligations under international human rights instruments \u2013 notably Articles 2, 3, 8 and 14 of the Convention and strict liability (objektivt ansvar).On 30 December 2005 Mr Muledal whose application (no. 22703/10) under the Convention is being dealt with simultaneously with the present one, together with Mr J. and Mr K. and twenty-eight other North Sea divers, also brought compensation proceedings raising similar claims.On 31 March 2006 Messrs Engebretsen and Eng, who have also lodged an application with a number of other claimaints (no. 24329/09), lodged compensation proceedings against the State before the City Court.After a preliminary session on 7 August 2006 the City Court decided to join all the above cases. On 21 January 2007, after a change of lawyer by Messrs Engebretsen and Eng, it disjoined the action brought by them from those lodged by other claimants.By a judgment of 10 August 2007 the Oslo City Court, sitting in a single judge formation and after having held a hearing between 26 February and 29 March 2007, ordered the State to pay the applicant NOK 6,527,302, plus NOK 4,880,479 in default interest (Mr Muledal was awarded NOK 3,123,420 plus interest, Mr K. was awarded NOK 5,946, 939, plus interest, whilst Mr J.\u2019s claim was rejected).As regards the scope of the State\u2019s obligations under Article 2 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, the City Court took note of the European Court\u2019s case-law (L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom, 9 June 1998, \u00a7 36, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011III); Osman v. the United Kingdom, 28 October 1998, \u00a7 116, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011VIII; \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey [GC], no. 48939/99, \u00a7 71, ECHR 2004\u2011XII). Against this background, the City Court considered that it would be decisive whether the State knew or ought to have known of a real and immediate risk to life and had done everything that it could reasonably be expected to do in order to avoid that risk.The City Court found it obvious that the Norwegian authorities had been aware of the real and immediate risk to life which professional diving in the North Sea had entailed. The dangers that variations in pressure could cause for divers and that a too rapid decompression could be life-threatening had been known, as had the dangers involved in errors in pressure and in composition of the breathing gas and the fact that the umbilical supplied divers with indispensable breathing gas, communication and heat. They had been aware that working on the seafloor as such had been life-threatening and that in the event of an emergency saving the divers could be problematic. On the whole, the various risks meant that divers had a particularly dangerous profession. A minor error, whether human or technical, could be life-threatening. This had been known both to the authorities and to the divers themselves.Of relevance was the authorities\u2019 knowledge and duty to take measures during the period from 1974 to 1989, when the plaintiffs had been professionally active.The City Court found that during the period under consideration the authorities had taken measures that could reasonably be expected of them in order to secure the divers\u2019 lives. It pointed to the legislative framework aimed at protecting the divers\u2019 lives. The City Court had regard to the supervision carried out as from 1969 by the Labour Inspection Authority and subsequently by the Petroleum Directorate and the work with decompression tables. Making an overall assessment, having regard also to the authorities\u2019 practices, in granting dispensations, the lack of State education in diving and divers work and employment conditions, the City Court found that the State had taken measures that it could reasonably be expected to take in order to protect divers\u2019 lives. Accordingly, there had been no violation of Article 2 of the Convention. The City Court also rejected the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that their right to protection of private life and health under Article 8 of the Convention had been violated. Regard was had to the Court\u2019s case-law (in particular L\u00f3pez Ostra v. Spain, 9 December 1994, Series A no. 303\u2011C, Fadeyeva v. Russia, no. 55723/00, ECHR 2005\u2011IV; and Ledyayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 53157/99, 53247/99, 53695/00 and 56850/00, 26 October 2006).As to the question whether the State was liable on strict liability grounds, the City Court considered inter alia that any right to compensation for divers could not be curtailed with reference to the argument that they had accepted the risks involved. A broader assessment had to be made, having regard to the interests of the parties to the case and to superior interests of a public character. A central question in any such assessment was to determine the entity who was the nearest to the risk that had triggered the damage and for that reason should be held liable. This was a question that ought to be based on a natural and reasonable weighing of interests, whether there was a need for strict liability in such matters or whether strict liability would lead to a reasonable outcome.In the present case, a small group consisting of approximately 400 strong, healthy young men had taken on jobs as professional divers at the beginning of what ought to be described as Norway\u2019s oil adventure. Even though the divers had had a very good salary, the City Court found that many of them had paid an unexpected price in respect of their health. The City Court noted the observation in the Loussius Commission\u2019s report (NOU p. 102) that a disturbing number of divers had been on disability pension and that relatively young people, even persons who were in their forties had been affected. This, together with the great number of cases of psychological damage, had suggested that many divers had carried a heavier burden than most people had to bear in their professional lives.Whilst finding irrelevant as a starting point how much Norwegian society had benefitted from oil revenues, the result of the oil adventure, that Norway had become one of the world\u2019s richest nations had been relevant in the balancing of interests. Even though the State\u2019s links to diving activities would be stretched beyond what was clearly covered by judicial practice, the City Court found that, on the whole, making the State liable for the damage to the diver\u2019s health would be reasonable and equitable. In light of these considerations, the City Court found the State liable on objective grounds. It was therefore not necessary to consider whether it was liable also on subjective grounds.5. Appeal to the High CourtThe State appealed against the City Court\u2019s judgment to the Borgarting High Court (lagmannsrett). The applicant and Mr Muledal lodged an appeal (as did also Messrs J. and K.) arguing that the amount of compensation awarded had been too low and maintained their request for a judgment holding that the Convention had been violated. The Offshoredykkerunionen (Offshore Divers Union) and IndustryEnergy intervened in support of Mr Muledal and other plaintiffs (but not the applicant).Between 12 August and 18 September 2008 the High Court held an oral hearing at which the parties with their representatives were heard, as were interveners and forty-three witnesses and certain expert witnesses.In a judgment of 28 November 2008 the Borgarting High Court found for the State and dismissed the compensation claims brought by the applicant and the other plaintiffs.(i) Issue of strict liabilityThe High Court first examined the issue of whether the State could be held liable on the ground of strict liability. It reiterated that this would depend on an overall assessment having regard to the interests of the parties and the superior interests of a public character, based on a balancing of interests in which the requirement of an adequate or foreseeable causal connection ought to be fulfilled. The damage ought to have resulted from a risk created by an activity, business, thing or installation and to which the allegedly liable person had a sufficiently strong link. In order to be covered, the risk ought to be constant, typical and extraordinary.The High Court considered that many factors suggested that diving activity in the North Sea had involved a constant, typical and extraordinary risk for the divers but saw no need to assess this further since in any event it did not consider that there was a sufficient link between the State and this activity.In this regard the High Court observed the following. The requirement of a link implied that strict liability lay with the proprietor of the risky activity. However, liability could also be founded on other circumstances. What those circumstances were was unclear but would depend on an overall assessment in which the question was whether the link was strong enough to make liability reasonable.In the counter-appellants\u2019 view, it was the overall role of the State in the petroleum sector that had made its link to the diving operations sufficiently strong. The State had owned the oil resources, had initiated the oil extraction, and had itself conducted oil extraction through companies owned by or dominated by the State such as Statoil and Norsk Hydro; it had regulated the activities by issuing legislation and regulations and could authorise dispensations; it had been empowered to grant licences and to act as a supervisory authority and had received considerable revenue through taxes and levies and the Direct Financial Participation by the State (Statens direkte \u00f8konomiske engasjement \u2013 \u201cSD\u00d8E\u201d). In sum, it had both a decisive control of the oil industry and the greatest interest in oil extraction.In this regard, the High Court observed that the State had not been the proprietor of the risky activity. The State had held a property right in respect of submarine oil resources, but it was the licence holders who had become the proprietors of the extracted oil. The State had not carried out oil extraction or diving operations in the North Sea. None of the counter-counter-appellants had ever been employed by the State as divers or had carried out diving for the State. Strict liability therefore ought to be grounded on other factors.The High Court did not disagree with the counter-appellants that the State was in a position to influence the level of security. Such influence did not concern exclusively the activities in the North Sea but any matter falling within security legislation. By issuing licences for oil extraction the State had in a sense contributed to setting in motion an activity which, by experience, soon or later led to accidents.Nonetheless, the position of the State as legislator and considerations based on equity vis-\u00e0-vis the divers could not be decisive in relation to the compensation issue. The State\u2019s role in connection with diving did not differ in principle from that in relation to other activities. Diving in the North Sea was not the only perilous activity in society. Nor was it decisive that the State harvested considerable financial profits from such activities. All activities could in principle be subject to regulation and State control. Oil extraction did not depend on divers alone but on many other professional groups. Also, there were many other activities that depended on personnel with specific professional competence. That it had been the State which had initiated the oil extraction was not peculiar to this sector.Nor could the State\u2019s ownership interests in Statoil and the SD\u00d8E justify strict liability for the State. Statoil had been a separate legal entity and the relationship between the State and the company had been governed by the Act on limited liability companies (Aksjeloven). With a few modifications the same had applied to the State\u2019s relationship with the SD\u00d8E.As regards Messrs Muledal\u2019s and K.\u2019s claims regarding test diving at the NUI AS (Norsk Undervannsintervensjon - Norwegian Underwater Intervention Ltd, \u201cthe NUI\u201d), the High Court pointed out that this had been an independent legal entity and there was no evidence to suggest that the test diving had been initiated by the State in any other way than by the latter requiring documentation that diving could be performed at great depths in order for authorisation to be issued for certain works. Nor had the State contributed significantly to the financing of the test dives. That the divers stress and the State\u2019s revenues had both been considerable could not alter the issue of principle.Many had regarded it as unfair and unreasonable that divers, who had risked their lives and health, and had thereby made it possible for the State and Norwegian society as a whole to harvest oil revenues from the North Sea, should not be compensated when they had sustained damage. The High Court, whilst considering that it was insignificant for ascertaining liability, added that divers had had a right to health care and social security benefits like the rest of the population and that they had in addition received not insignificant amounts under various compensation schemes described above, after Parliament, regardless of the rules on compensation, had assessed the matter weighing divers\u2019 interests against those of the public. Thus, approximately NOK 3,600,000 (corresponding to EUR 455,000) had been paid out to the applicant (NOK 3,280,000 (approximately EUR 417,000) to Mr Muledal, NOK 3,500,000 to Mr K. and NOK 5,250,000 to Mr J.). Whether they should receive additional compensation from the State, irrespective of the latter\u2019s legal obligations, was a political question that was not for the courts to decide.In the High Court\u2019s view, it had been unnecessary for the counter-appellants to sue the State for compensation. All of the diving companies in question still existed, in a merged or restructured form. In addition, under section 10-9(1) of the Petroleum Act 1994, the oil companies were liable jointly and severally together with the wrongdoer. Corresponding rules had applied throughout the period during which the counter-appellants were diving in the North Sea. Both the employers and the operating companies could be sued. Whilst the most expedient course of action was for the counter-appellants to sue the State, such a consideration could not be given much weight in the assessment of whether the State could be held liable.The High Court considered that it was still the case that the starting point ought to be that any business should be operated at its proprietor\u2019s risk and expense. Since the State\u2019s role in relation to diving activities did not in principle differ from that in any other risky business, holding the State strictly liable in the present instance would most probably mean that it could be held liable for damage in most other areas where the proprietor of a risky business was responsible on strict liability grounds. The law in its current state did not lend support to expanding the scope of the State\u2019s strict liability to such an extent. Whilst there were certainly arguments for and against such an expansion, this was not a matter for the courts to decide.(ii) Issue of employer\u2019s liabilityThe High Court next considered the issue of liability of the State under section 2-1 of the Damage Compensation Act 1969, according to which an employer was liable for damage caused with intent or negligence by an employee in the performance of his or her duties. It was not necessary to identify the employee who had committed the fault or to link the damage to a specific act. The liability covered the overall effect of individual acts even though the effect of each act was not sufficient to establish liability. As a starting point, the ground also covered acts carried out in the exercise of public authority. However, Parliament\u2019s legislative and budgetary activities were not covered. The State could not be viewed as a private-law entity for these purposes.Nonetheless, a number of the matters raised by the divers could have been taken up in connection with the security assessment made by control- and supervisory bodies prior to their authorising specific diving operations. For example, they could have set as a condition that slow diving tables be used with caution.The High Court considered that in the main the State had been aware of the conditions in the North Sea, including divers\u2019 working conditions. However, because of deficient reporting they had probably not had a complete picture of the extent of near-accidents and other undesirable occurrences. The State had also been aware of divers\u2019 demands for improvements.The risk had been part of diving activity and the purpose of supervision and control had been to reduce this risk. In any event, regardless of any shortcomings in the system of supervision, those who had exercised the activities had had the responsibility for ensuring that the oil business, including diving, was performed in a secure manner in accordance with the applicable rules (see sections 10-6, 10-1, 10-9 of the Petroleum Act). In the High Court\u2019s view, a business ought to be conducted at the risk and expense of the entity carrying it out. Earnings and responsibilities ought to be placed in the hands of the same legal entity. The purpose of supervision had never been to reduce wrongdoers\u2019 liability. The circumstance that an operation should not have been authorised could not automatically lead to liability for the State for accidents caused by the operation.As regards the legal framework, the Diving Regulation of 1978 could possibly have been adopted earlier. Any delay could be explained by the number of public bodies assuming responsibilities in the North Sea and by cooperation being unsatisfactory at times. However, diving had not been a lawless activity even before then. The 1967 Safety Regulation had contained specific provisions in its section 121 about diving, according to which diving was to be carried out in a secure manner and after prior authorisation. After England, Norway had been the first country in the North Sea area to introduce rules on diving. England had adopted its rules in 1975, the USA in 1981 and Denmark in 1995. The High Court could therefore not accept that the 1978 Regulation had set aside requirements that could reasonably be imposed to such an extent that the State could be held liable.Nor could the High Court find that the manner of organisation of the supervision and control by the State had been deficient and could give rise to liability for the State. The extent of resources made available had been a matter that depended on budgetary decisions by Parliament. The Labour Inspection Authority, which authority had assumed responsibility for supervision until 1 April 1978, already had such responsibility with respect to most businesses, not only divers in the North Sea. Despite this, one person had been assigned to this particular task. Bearing in mind the other risky activities that existed and the funds allocated, the High Court could not find that this was negligent. Nor could the fact that the incumbent had been an engineer with technical competence who was more focused on technical installations rather than diving medical matters be viewed as negligence. The fact that divers had wished for more extensive supervision could not be decisive. Within the Petroleum Directorate, a diving section with five employees had been set up.With the benefit of hindsight, the High Court could agree with the counter-appellants that it might seem as if the applicable rules had not always been implemented. In certain instances authorisation had been granted after the operations. A practice had been developed whereby dispensation had been granted on the basis of agreements between the operator, the divers, the divers\u2019 unions and the safety deputy. This practice had had the drawback that the individual diver had been in a weak negotiating position because of a risk in certain instances of being moved onshore when he was perceived as being difficult. Time-limits for applications and working hours had not always been respected. The High Court also agreed that under certain provisions of the 1978 Regulation and its Appendix, divers could demand the production of the diving table used in a given diving operation. Whether it was safe to use a table had been something that should have formed part of the basis for authorising a diving operation. It did not seem reassuring that tables had not been reviewed because employees of the Petroleum Directorate had not understood them.However, the assessment of what requirements could reasonably be imposed on the service and the activities had to be made in the light of the then prevailing perceptions of the risk involved in diving. The only possibility of removing all risk would have been to impose a total prohibition on diving. That had never been in question either in Norway or in any other countries. The prevailing view had been that diving was justified even though diving led to fatal and other serious accidents. The question for a supervisory authority had therefore always been centred on the level of risk that was justifiable. Whether to grant authorisation for a given diving operation depended on a balancing of interests. Those of the divers weighed heavily, but were not the only ones. There was reason to display judicial restraint in reviewing this balancing exercise, especially after such a long lapse of time and changes in perceptions.The High Court pointed out that the assessment of what could be regarded a justifiable risk ought to be based on the knowledge and perceptions of this matter at the time in question. That sudden changes in pressure could have a great impact on the organism and could in the worst case be life-threatening had been known for a long time. However, there had been less knowledge about the long-term effects. On the evidence the High Court found it established that it was widely believed that diving did not have serious long-term effects in the absence of decompression sickness. Where such illness had only involved temporary pain, notably after treatment in a compression chamber, the condition had also been regarded as relatively risk free. It appeared that decompression sickness had been regarded as a part of diving, an inconvenience to be avoided but one which had to be accepted. It had been treated with recompression and had been regarded as finally treated in this way (NOU 2003:5, p. 76).Opinions about the long-term effects of diving had not been entirely unequivocal. A number of reports, scientific opinions, medical statements, articles, etc on the possible long-term effects had been adduced before the High Court and the parties had relied on those opinions that supported their own views. The High Court observed that present-day knowledge was of no importance for the assessment of liability to pay compensation in respect of events that had occurred many years ago. It was not possible, nor necessary, for the High Court to take a stance on the disagreement between scientists and in the scientific milieu. It was sufficient to note that there existed a disagreement. The High Court found it established that in the context of the issue of liability to pay compensation there had been scientific support for the perceptions of the State as to the possibility of long-term effects. That there were other scientists who held other views could not be decisive.The High Court found it established that the psychological effects of extreme, life-threatening and, especially, repeated incidents had been known. All the counter-appellants had described incidents that involved such a degree of stress that their condition could be regarded as Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome (PTSD). The High Court found it most probable that Mr Muledal and C had developed PTSD. The applicant had suffered minor brain damage and had in this connection developed an organic personality disorder. The High Court agreed with the divers that the State ought to have been aware of these aspects of diving activities and that a number of divers most probably would suffer psychological damage. The Labour Inspection Authority expected that diving at ever greater depths might lead to psychological problems for divers. A stricter implementation of the requirement that diving should be safe would most probably have contributed to reducing the stress level. Nevertheless, a certain level of danger and stress had to be accepted if diving was to take place. It had been impossible to say to what extent the stress burden could have been reduced and whether such reduction would have been sufficient to prevent the counter-appellants from sustaining psychological damage. A certain level of stress had in any event been inevitable.The High Court moreover found no evidence in support of the argument that, apart from increasing the stress level, exposure to noise, pollution, chemicals and other inconveniences had entailed any financial damage for the counter-appellants.As regards the question of the grant of administrative dispensation from security requirements, the High Court observed that account had to be taken of the risks involved if no dispensation was given. For instance, the burden of prolonging the saturation time (metningstid) for a diver team already in operation had to be compared with the inconvenience of placing a new team under compression. The danger of prolonging an umbilical had to be compared to the danger of the diving vessel being positioned closer to the installations, etc. Even though practices had developed in such a way that a dispensation would be granted if all the interests involved, including when the divers and their representatives had accepted it, the High Court had no basis for holding that the Petroleum Directorate had disregarded the interest of protecting divers\u2019 safety or that the assessments made had otherwise been unjustified. Also, the dispensation practices ought to be considered in light of the legal framework. In Norway it had been decided to opt for rules that had been relatively restrictive on the assumption that dispensations would be used more extensively rather than for a scheme with less strict rules and a lesser need for dispensations (NOU 2003:5, p. 81). Even though the Petroleum Directorate had regularly granted dispensations in summary form, it had not been sufficiently shown that the control had been of no reality.The High Court agreed with the counter-appellants that, according to present day opinions, it might seem imprudent to have authorised diving operations involving the use of decompression tables that had previously led to accidents. However, at the time, those tables had been commonly in use, not just in the Norwegian part of the North Sea. No other country with the exception of Norway had introduced standard decompression tables. The accidents that had occurred had never given rise to legal proceedings against the State. While it might have been desirable that the supervisory authorities had applied a stricter practice with regard to the authorisation of rapid decompression tables, in light of the conditions at the time the High Court did not consider that this could justify liability.Nor did the High Court find that the way in which the authorities had acted in handling licensing matters had disregarded safety in a manner giving rise to liability, even though from the divers\u2019 point of view it would have been desirable that their interests had been better protected.The State\u2019s ownership of the petroleum resources could not justify liability for accidents related to oil extraction. It had been the position that the licence holders had acquired ownership of the petroleum produced (see section 3-3(3), second sentence, of the Petroleum Act), thereby absolving the State from liability as owner, and that the ownership of the State had been limited to the oil resources under the sea floor.Even though the supervisory authorities had committed certain errors, there was no support for holding that that divers\u2019 working environment on the Norwegian continental shelf had been regarded as worse than that in other countries extracting oil in the same maritime area. The accident rates had not been significantly higher in the Norwegian area.The test diving at the NUI had not been the responsibility of the State. The NUI had always been a separate legal entity without any links to the State. The latter had not commissioned the tests. In connection with its prior approval of a pipeline crossing the Norwegian trench (Norskerenna), the State had required documentation that it was possible to carry out diving in such deep waters. The State had participated in the financing of one of the test dives. However this could not make the State liable.The ethical aspects of the test dives had been considered and approved by the Council for Medical Research (R\u00e5det for medisinsk forskning). There had been no requirement that the Labour Inspection Authority give prior authorisation. Employees of the Petroleum Directorate had been present as observers but not in a supervisory capacity. It would have been difficult for them to intervene if the tests had not been carried out in accordance, as alleged by Mr Muledal and A, with the description in the request to the Council or with other rules.Nor could the research carried out lead to liability on the part of the State.Similar considerations had applied to divers\u2019 demands for training. The High Court acknowledged that training and competence building would generally contribute to reducing the risk of diving and the accident rate. The applicant had pointed to several concrete accidents which in his view had all been due to a lack of training. The High Court found it established that doubts about the level of competence of fellow divers and superiors had contributed to increasing the burden of stress and for this reason training had been desirable. However, this had been a question of allocation of resources and a regulatory framework would have had to be introduced had training been made obligatory.The High Court did not share the applicant\u2019s view that the State had been the actual wrongdoer. The wrongdoers had been those who had conducted the diving activities. In addition, the licence holders had been jointly and severally liable for the damage (section 10-9 of the Petroleum Act). That diving \u2013 especially North-Sea diving in its earlier phase \u2013 had involved extreme risks called for no further explanation. The purpose of putting in place supervision and a legal framework had been to reduce that risk. An alternative for the State would have been to avoid liability by doing nothing. It did not follow from the fact that the State by taking different measures had sought to reduce the risks involved in a lawful, but dangerous activity that the State had thereby taken on the responsibility for ensuring that such measures were at all times sufficient. The fact that the State had contributed significantly to the accident rate decreasing over time did not mean that the previous situation had been unjustifiable.The applicant had invoked certain specific incidents at the diving vessel Arctic Surveyor in 1977, where he had been exposed to serious decompression sickness, and at the diving vessel Tender Comet in 1983, relating to dispensation from the maximum length of the umbilical.As regards the first incident, the High Court did not find it possible to ascertain whether the security level of the operation had departed from what had normally been perceived as safe diving in 1977 according to section 121 of the Safety Regulation. The applicant\u2019s injuries had been diagnosed later. In the High Court\u2019s view there had been no basis for holding the State liable for having authorised the diving operation in question.As regards the diving operation from Tender Comet, the High Court noted that the applicant\u2019s criticism had been upheld and that in 1983 employees of the Petroleum Directorate had disagreed on whether the operation should have been authorised or stopped. However, if the Petroleum Directorate had committed faults, this had not necessarily meant that those requirements that could reasonably be set for their services had been ignored. In this regard, responsibility had also lain with the operator and the diving company and authorisation had not meant that the State had taken over financial responsibility for any faults imputable to them. Even though it was established that the Petroleum Directorate should not have authorised the operation, this would not suffice to make the State liable.In light of the above, the High Court found that there was no basis for holding the State liable on subjective grounds.(iii) Issue of liability on grounds of human rights violationsThe High Court then went on to examine the counter-appellants\u2019 allegations of violations of human rights conventions, notably of Articles 2, 3, 8 and 14 of the Convention. It observed that even thought the State could not be held liable under national law in respect of Parliament\u2019s legislative measures and budgetary practices, the State could be held accountable under the Convention.In this regard, the High Court noted that the Convention case-law prayed-in-aid by the counter-appellants had concerned damage inflicted on individuals and property in their personal sphere. However, the High Court had not been aware of any case-law of the European Court or of any other tribunals concerning the application of the Convention in respect of parties engaged in professional activities. It had therefore been difficult to determine the scope of the Convention obligations to take measures to reduce risks in this area. The same applied to test diving at the NUI.As a starting point it had been up to the industrial parties to agree on conditions of employment, including on the matter of risk by paying higher salaries or by taking risk-reducing measures. The High Court assumed that Contracting States ought to be accorded a wide margin of appreciation in the choice of measures they were required to take in order to reduce professional risks. The State was probably less obliged to interfere in the relationship between an employer and an employee than with regard to businesses that posed a danger to third parties. The High Court found no support for holding that the diving activities on the Norwegian shelf had been more dangerous or that the working environment had been worse there compared to diving activities in other comparable areas.6. Appeal to the Supreme CourtThe applicant appealed to the Supreme Court complaining that the Norwegian authorities had given prior approval to diving operations carried out from the vessels (1) Arctic Surveyor and (2) Tender Comet, (3) had authorised dispensation from the requirements regarding the maximum length of the umbilical used in a diving operation from Tender Comet and (4) had omitted to stop diving operations from Tender Comet. He maintained that, regardless of whether there had been any negligence, the State was liable to pay him compensation on the ground that these acts or failure to act had been in breach of the applicable rules requiring that diving take place in a safe manner (section 121 of Royal Decree of 25 August 1967). In the alternative, he submitted that, regardless of whether the said acts or failure to act had been unlawful, they had involved a failure on the part of the State to comply with its obligations under Articles 2, 3, 8, and 14 of the Convention. In the further alternative, the applicant argued that the legal framework as such had entailed a violation of the Convention. In a further submission he submitted that the State had been liable as an employer under section 2-1 of the 1969 Damage Compensation Act. Also in this context, he invoked the Convention. Finally, he argued that the State had been responsible on grounds of strict liability for the damage he had sustained from the diving operations.On 24 March 2009 the Appeals Leave Committee of the Supreme Court (a) refused the plaintiffs leave to appeal with respect to the assessment of the evidence regarding the question of liability whilst allowing them to adduce certain supplementary evidence and (b) refused the applicant leave with regard to his liability claims concerning points (1) to (4) above. As for the remainder the Appeals Leave Committee granted the plaintiffs leave to pursue their appeal. It further decided that the appeal proceedings should be limited to the issue of grounds for liability and postponed the issues of causality and assessment of damages to a later stage.By a judgment of 8 October 2009 the Supreme Court unanimously rejected their appeals. On reasoning similar to that of the High Court, it concluded that the circumstances adduced, whether considered on their own or together, did not involve a sufficiently close connection between the State and the harmful activity to justify holding the State liable on the basis of the general principle of strict liability. While it was true that the State had been actively involved in the oil sector there was no difference of principle between this and a number of other areas. As regards deep-sea diving, the State\u2019s role had been limited to supervision and control. This was not something which created a close connection and could not be distinguished from other instances of public supervision and control.Nor did the Supreme Court find that the State was liable as an employer for negligence, under section 2-1 of the Damage Compensation Act 1969, notably on account of the activities performed by the Labour Inspectorate and the Petroleum Directorate. The Supreme Court had regard to the development of the relevant regulations aimed at safeguarding security, the manner of organising the control and implementation of the safety rules, the practice of giving dispensations, inspections, training, diving equipment. The Supreme Court found no basis for holding that either of the above instances had been passive.Finally, the Supreme Court considered whether there had been a violation of the Convention.As regards the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint under Article 2 of the Convention, the Supreme Court observed that this provision was applicable not only in the event of loss of lives but also when in the circumstances there was a threat to physical integrity (Budayeva and Others v. Russia, nos. 15339/02, 21166/02, 20058/02, 11673/02 and 15343/02, \u00a7 146, ECHR 2008\u2011...). This provision further obliged States to refrain from deprivation of life and to take appropriate steps to safeguard lives. This obligation to safeguard lives entailed above all a primary duty on the State to put in place a legislative and administrative framework designed to provide effective deterrence against threats to the right to life. This applied in the context of any activity, whether public or not, in which the right to life was at stake (Ibidem, \u00a7\u00a7 128-131, a case which concerned a landslide). The Supreme Court also took note of Guerra and Others v. Italy (emission of poisonous gases) (19 February 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011I.); L.C.B. v. the United Kingdom (health hazards from atomic explosions) (9 June 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998\u2011III), \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z v. Turkey (methane gas explosion at a rubbish heap) ([GC], no. 48939/99, ECHR 2004\u2011XII). The Supreme Court observed that none of these cases had concerned threats to life occasioned by professional risk. On the latter subject, in so far as the Supreme Court was aware, there were no judgments delivered by the European Court, though its statements of principles had been formulated in such a general way that it could not be excluded that it would at least to some degree apply Article 2 on such matters. It was not necessary to go further into this since there had in any event been no breach of this provision in the present case.The Supreme Court observed that from the European Court\u2019s case-law it followed that in the event that there was a real and immediate danger to life, and this danger was or ought to have been known to the authorities, the latter might be required to take special measures. In the assessment of what steps ought to be taken, the State would in principle have a margin of appreciation. An impossible or disproportionate burden could not be imposed, since the State had to make operational choices in terms of priorities and resources (Budayeva and Others, \u00a7\u00a7 134 and 135; see also L.C.B., cited above, \u00a7 38; and \u00d6nery\u0131ld\u0131z, cited above, \u00a7\u00a7 100-101).However, in the instant case, the State had in accordance with the law adopted extensive regulations on diving activities. An administrative framework had been set up and supervision of it had been entrusted to the Labour Inspection Authority and the Petroleum Directorate. Moreover, funding had been allocated to their activities according to priorities and in light of available resources. There had been nothing to suggest that the supervisory bodies in question had been passive when they had become aware that transgressions of the rules involving risk had occurred. The measures taken had been based on what they knew at the material time. Therefore, it did not emerge that Article 2 of the Convention had been violated.As regards the plaintiffs\u2019 complaint of violation of Article 8 of the Convention, the Supreme Court took note of their argument based on the European Court\u2019s case-law in relation to ransacking and seizure of documents on professional premises, notably Niemietz v. Germany, 16 December 1992, Series A no. 251\u2011B). However, the subject-matter of such cases had been so different from that at issue in the present case that the Supreme Court could not rely on them.The plaintiffs had also prayed-in-aid case-law concerning health risk caused by pollution. However, in this regard the Supreme Court observed that Article 8 had come into play mainly because private and family life was enjoyed in the home. On this point the Supreme Court quoted the following passage from Giacomelli v. Italy, no. 59909/00, \u00a7 76, ECHR 2006\u2011XII:\u201cArticle 8 of the Convention protects the individual\u2019s right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence. A home will usually be the place, the physically defined area, where private and family life develops. The individual has a right to respect for his home, meaning not just the right to the actual physical area, but also to the quiet enjoyment of that area. Breaches of the right to respect for the home are not confined to concrete or physical breaches, such as unauthorised entry into a person\u2019s home, but also include those that are not concrete or physical, such as noise, emissions, smells or other forms of interference. A serious breach may result in the breach of a person\u2019s right to respect for his home if it prevents him from enjoying the amenities of his home.\u201dThus, also the European Court\u2019s case-law regarding damage to health resulting from pollution was not immediately comparable to the present case.The Supreme Court noted that Roche v. the United Kingdom [GC] (no. 32555/96, \u00a7\u00a7 155-169, ECHR 2005\u2011X). was the only judgment invoked by the parties that had concerned possible damage to health sustained in connection with professional activities. The applicant in that case had served in the British Army and had for a period voluntarily participated in experiments on mustard gas and nerve gas. He had claimed that this had caused him injuries and had demanded access to the case documents. The European Court had found Article 8 applicable and that this provision had been violated on account of the refusal to grant the applicant access to the documents in question. This judgment gave support to the view that test diving had been covered by Article 8 but not so risky diving in general. However, it was not necessary to determine this question since any obligation to take safety measures that might follow from Article 8 had in any event been complied with. In this connection, reference was made to the discussion above under Article 2.Also, there could be no question that the conditions pertaining to diving generally, as alleged by the applicant, could amount to inhuman and degrading treatment in the sense of Article 3.As to the test dives carried out at NUTEC, in which Mr Muledal and Mr C had participated, the Supreme Court observed that under Article 7 of the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, no one should be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation. A similar protection probably followed from Article 3 of the European Convention. In the present case, it was clear that the divers had been informed about the test dives beforehand. A written guide had been elaborated and there was nothing to indicate that the test dives in question had been carried out otherwise than planned. The test dives had been approved in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration prepared by the World Association of Doctors in 1964, NUTEC practice and the guidelines of the Ministry of Social Affairs of 8 June 1984 on the mandate of regional committees on the ethics of medical research. There was no support for holding that the delayed injuries sustained by Mr Muledal and C were attributable to these test dives. The tests had been carried out in light of the information available at the time, from which it had appeared that test dives involving far greater depths had been carried out in the USA, England, France and Switzerland. Accordingly, there had been no breach of Articles 3 or 8 of the Convention or of Article 7 of the International Covenant.Nor did the Supreme Court find any support for the applicant\u2019s complaint of violation of Article 14 of the Convention.COMPLAINTSThe applicant complained that the four specific acts or failure to act highlighted in his appeal to the Supreme Court constituted a failure on the part of the authorities of the respondent State to protect his right to life under Article 2 of the Convention. Also, the procedural requirements of Article 2 could have been complied with if the police investigation had not been hindered by the Petroleum Directorate.Furthermore, under Article 2, he complained more generally that the respondent State had failed to take appropriate steps to protect divers\u2019 lives, namely to devise an effective framework of rules coupled with supervision in order to identify and take corrective measures in respect of defects endangering human lives.In addition, the respondent State had failed in its duty to provide him with adequate information (about the risk to which he was exposed by taking on diving jobs in the North Sea).The applicant also complained that the State had failed to take appropriate measures to protect him against inhuman and degrading treatment, in violation of Article 3, and to protect his health, in breach of Article 8.Finally the applicant invoked Article 14..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications. For this reason, whilst the case does not significantly contribute to the development of the ECtHR's case law, it nevertheless raises a particular point of interest.\"};\n                                        Level 3 text: The application concerns an Ivorian national, who reached Malta by boat in November 2021. On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicant, Mr Ibrahim Suso Musa, is a Sierra Leonean national, who was born in 1983 and lives in Safi, Malta. He is represented before the Court by Dr N. Falzon, a lawyer practising in Valletta.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicant, may be summarised as follows.1. Background of the caseThe applicant entered Malta in an irregular manner by boat on 8 April 2011. Upon arrival, he was arrested by the police and presented with a Return Decision and Removal Order in view of his presence in Malta as a prohibited immigrant in terms of Article 5 of the Immigration Act (Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta). He was defined as such due to his entry into Malta in an irregular manner, and to the consideration that he did not have sufficient means to support himself. The Return Decision informed the applicant of the possibility to apply for a period of voluntary departure. It also contained, in the same document, a Removal Order based on the rejection of the applicant\u2019s request for a period of voluntary departure. It noted that the request had not been acceded to for the following reasons: due to a risk that he may abscond; his application for legal stay was considered as manifestly unfounded or fraudulent; and he was considered to be a threat to public policy, public security or national security.In fact, the applicant never actually made a request for a voluntary departure period, since the rejection was automatically presented with the information regarding the possibility to request it. The applicant was never informed on the considerations leading to this decision or given any opportunity to present information, documentation and/or other evidence in support of a possible request for a voluntary departure period.The applicant was further informed, through the Return Decision and Removal Order, of his right to appeal the Decision and Order before the Immigration Appeals Board (\u201cIAB\u201d) within three working days. No further information was provided on the appeals procedure, including information on access to legal assistance.On the basis of the Return Decision and Removal Order, and in terms of the Immigration Act, the applicant was detained in Safi Barracks with a view to his deportation from Malta.2. Asylum proceedingsOn 14 April 2011, whilst in Safi Barracks, the applicant submitted the Preliminary Questionnaire, the first stage of his application for asylum in Malta.On 31 December 2011 the applicant\u2019s asylum application was rejected by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner who considered that the claim as presented failed to meet the criteria for recognition of refugee status.On 24 January 2012 the applicant appealed to the Refugee Appeals Board. Submissions were presented on 29 March 2012.On 2 April 2012 the Refugee Appeals Board rejected the applicant\u2019s appeal, thereby definitively closing his asylum procedure almost twelve months after his arrival in Malta.3. Proceedings challenging the legality of detentionIn the meantime, pending the above asylum proceedings, on 28 June 2011 the applicant filed an application before the IAB in order to challenge the legality of his detention in terms of the Immigration Act.The application was based on Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention and Regulation 11(10) of the Common Standards and Procedures for Returning Illegally Staying Third-Country Nationals Regulations (Legal Notice 81 of 2011, hereinafter \u201cLN 81\u201d) (See Relevant Domestic Law below). In his application the applicant argued that the decision to detain him as well as his on-going detention, were contrary to law. With regard to the original decision to detain him, the applicant argued that, contrary to the requirements of the above-mentioned Regulation 11(8), when he was presented with the Return Decision and Removal Order no evaluation had been made as to the possibility of exploring \u201cother sufficient and less coercive measures\u201d. Furthermore, in deciding to detain him, the responsible authorities decided a priori without an individual assessment of his situation that he presented a risk of absconding and that he was avoiding or hindering the return or removal procedure. Moreover, the decision was taken without the applicant having made a request for voluntary departure. The applicant further argued that his on-going detention was also contrary to law on the basis of the presentation, in April 2011, of his asylum application, by virtue of which return procedures could not be commenced or continued in his regard in terms of Regulation 12 of the Procedural Regulations in Examining Applications for Refugee Status Regulations (Legal Notice 243 of 2008, hereinafter \u201cLN 243\u201d) (see Relevant Domestic Law).On 27 September 2011 the Immigration Police responded to the applicant\u2019s application before the IAB, and this was followed by further submissions by the applicant. On 22 November 2011 the IAB issued a decree requesting the parties to submit further information on specific queries raised by the Board. The applicant made further submissions highlighting the delay that was being created in the proceedings and final submissions were also made by the Immigration Police.On 5 July 2012, more than a year after the applicant\u2019s challenge, the IAB rejected his application. It noted that, despite the fact that according to Regulation 11 (1) of LN 81, Part IV of those Regulations did not apply to persons who were apprehended or intercepted by the competent authorities in connection with the irregular crossing by sea or air of the external border of Malta and who have not subsequently obtained an authorisation or a right to stay in Malta, the applicant had obtained the right to stay (\u201cjoqg\u0127od\u201d) in Malta upon lodging his application for asylum. Indeed it had been correct to rely on Regulation 12 (1) of LN 243 which stated that an individual had the right of entry and to remain on the island pending a decision on his asylum request, which, in the present case, applied to the applicant when he instituted his challenge before the IAB. As a matter of fact, in the applicant\u2019s case, had the asylum request still been pending, Section IV of LN 81 would in fact have been applicable, in particular in so far as an individual could not be kept in detention unless return proceedings were underway or if he or she presented a risk of absconding. However, the situation had changed given that on 2 April 2012 the applicant\u2019s asylum request had been rejected by a final decision. The latter implied that Section IV of LN 81 was no longer applicable to the applicant and thus the IAB could no longer decide on the request in terms of Regulation 11 (8) of LN 81. Moreover, the applicant was not arguing the illegality of his detention on the basis of its length. In any event the IAB was not competent to decide whether there was a breach of Article 5 of the Convention.4. Criminal proceedingsPending the above processes, on 16 August 2011 a riot broke out at Safi Barracks, resulting in a number of detained migrants, police officers and soldiers of the Armed Forces of Malta being injured. That same day, twenty-three migrants were arrested and charged in court in relation to the riot. The applicant was amongst the arrested persons and, together with the others, was accused of a number of offences including damage to private property, use of violence against public officers, refusal to obey legitimate orders and disruption of public peace and good order. The arrested men, including the applicant, were taken to Corradino Correctional Facility to await the outcome of the criminal proceedings.The following day, on 17 August 2011, the Court of Magistrates confirmed that the arrest of the migrants, including the applicant, was justified and in accordance with the law. They were remanded in custody.On 30 January 2012, the Court of Magistrates granted the applicant bail, in terms of which he was released from Corradino Correctional Facility and returned to Safi Barracks.5. Latest InformationAccording to the latest information provided by the applicant, on 11 October 2012, he was still detained and criminal proceedings in relation to the riot at Safi Barracks were still pending.B. Relevant domestic law and practice1. The Immigration ActAsylum procedures are mainly regulated by the Immigration Act (\u201cthe Act\u201d), Chapter 217 of the Laws of Malta. Article 5 of the Act defines the term prohibited immigrant and, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\u201c(1) Any person, other than one having the right of entry, or of entry and residence, or of movement or transit under the preceding Parts, may be refused entry, and if he lands or is in Malta without leave from the Principal Immigration Officer, he shall be a prohibited immigrant.(2) Notwithstanding that he has landed or is in Malta with the leave of the Principal Immigration Officer or that he was granted a residence permit, a person shall, unless he is exempted under this Act from any of the following conditions or special rules applicable to him under the foregoing provisions of this Act, be a prohibited immigrant also -(a) if he is unable to show that he has the means of supporting himself and his dependants (if any) or if he or any of his dependants is likely to become a charge on the public funds; or ...\u201dArticle 10 of the Act, regarding temporary detention, in so far as relevant reads as follows:\u201c(1) Where leave to land is refused to any person arriving in Malta on an aircraft ...(2) Where leave to land is refused to any person arriving in Malta by any other means, such person at his own request may, with the leave of the Principal Immigration Officer, be placed temporarily on shore and detained in some place approved by the Minister and notified by notice in the Gazette:Provided that he shall be returned to the vessel by which he is to leave Malta immediately that he makes a request to that effect or that the Principal Immigration Officer so directs, whichever is the earlier.(3) Any person, while he is detained under sub-article (1) or (2), shall be deemed to be in legal custody and not to have landed.\u201dIn practice, upon being apprehended a prohibited immigrant is issued with a removal order, in accordance with Article 14 of the Act, which, in so far as relevant, reads as follows:\u201c(1) If any person is considered by the Principal Immigration Officer to be liable to removal as a prohibited immigrant under any of the provisions of article 5, the said Officer may issue a removal order against such person who shall have a right to appeal against such order in accordance with the provisions of article 25A:Provided that in relation to any such person as may be prescribed by regulations made under article 4A and who entered Malta or is in Malta, a removal order shall only be issued following an application to that effect by the Principal Immigration Officer to the Board which shall make such order upon being satisfied that such person is liable to expulsion under this Act. The provisions of article 25A shall mutatis mutandis apply to any order issued by the said Board under this proviso.(2) Upon such order being made, such person against whom such order is made, shall be detained in custody until he is removed from Malta.\u201dAn \u201cirregular\u201d immigrant is entitled to apply for recognition of refugee status by means of an application (in the form of a Preliminary Questionnaire) to the Commissioner for Refugees within two months of arrival. While the application is being processed, in accordance with Maltese policy, the asylum seeker will remain in detention for a period up to 18 months, which may be extended if upon rejection of the application, he or she refuses to co-operate in respect of his or her repatriation.2. Relevant subsidiary legislationPart IV of Subsidiary Legislation 217.12, Common Standards and Procedures for Returning Illegally Staying Third-Country Nationals Regulations, Legal Notice 81 of 2011 (Transposing Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals), in so far as relevant, reads as follows:Regulation 11(1) The provisions of Part IV shall not apply to third country nationals who are subject to a refusal of entry in accordance with Article 13 of the Schengen Borders Code or who are apprehended or intercepted by the competent authorities in connection with the irregular crossing by sea or air of the external border of Malta and who have not subsequently obtained an authorisation or a right to stay in Malta.(2) A return decision, an entry-ban decision and a removal order shall be issued in writing and shall contain reasons in fact and in law and information on legal remedies:Provided that the reasons in fact may be given in a restrictive way where the withholding of information is regulated by law, in particular where the disclosure of information endangers national security, public policy, and the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of criminal offences.(3) A return decision shall be issued in a standard form and general information as regards such form shall be given in at least five languages which third-country nationals may reasonably be supposed to understand.(4) The Board shall review decisions related to return on application by the third-country national as refer red to in subregulation (2), and may temporarily suspend their enforcement.(5) For the purposes of sub-regulation (4) a legal adviser shall be allowed to assist the third-country national and, where entitled to, free legal aid shall be provided to the third-country national.(6) The Principal Immigration Officer shall provide, upon request, a written or oral translation of the main elements of a return decision and information on the legal remedies in a language the third-country national may reasonably be supposed to understand. ...(8) Where a third-country national is the subject of return procedures, unless other sufficient and less coercive measures are applicable, the Principal Immigration Officer may only keep him in detention in order to carry out the return and removal procedure, in particular where:(a) there is a risk of absconding; or(b) the third-country national avoids or hinders the return or removal procedure:Provided that the detention shall be for a short period and shall subsist as long as the removal procedure is in progress and is executed with due diligence.(9) Detention shall be a consequence of the removal order issued by the Principal Immigration Officer and it shall contain reasons in fact and in law.(10) The third-country national subject to the provisions of subregulation (8) shall be entitled to institute proceedings before the Board to contest the lawfulness of detention and such proceedings shall be subject to a speedy judicial review.(11) Where the third-country national is entitled to institute proceedings as provided in sub-regulation (10) he shall immediately be informed about such proceedings.(12) The third country-national shall be immediately released from detention where in the opinion of the Board such detention is not lawful.\u201dRegulation 12 (1) of the Procedural Standards in Examining Applications for Refugee Status Regulations (Legal Notice 243 of 2008), Subsidiary Legislation 420.07 provides as follows:\u201c(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other law to the contrary, and except where a subsequent application will not be further examined, or where an applicant is to be surrendered or extradited as appropriate to another Member State pursuant to obligations in accordance with a European Arrest Warrant or otherwise, or to a third country or to international criminal courts or tribunals, an applicant shall not be removed from Malta before his application is finally determined and such applicant shall be allowed to enter or remain in Malta pending a final decision of his application.\u201dCOMPLAINTSThe applicant complains under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention that his detention from 8 April 2011 to 16 August 2011 and from 30 January 2012 to the present date did not fall under any of the situations provided for by Article 5 and more particularly that it had not been carried out to prevent his unauthorised entry into Malta or with a view to his deportation, given that, he was pending a decision on his asylum application and the consequential authorisation in terms of Regulation 12 of Legal Notice 243 of 2008. Without prejudice to the above, he contended that the Maltese authorities had not sought alternatives to his detention, despite its length and that the conditions of detention were not adequate. Moreover, making reference to the case of Louled Massoud v. Malta (no. 24340/08, 27 July 2010) he noted that to date there were no procedural safeguards against arbitrary detention.The applicant also complains under Article 5 \u00a7 2 that upon his arrival he was not provided with any information regarding the specific reason for his detention.The applicant further complains that the Maltese legal system did not provide him with a speedy and efficient remedy, contrary to Article 5 \u00a7 4 of the Convention.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria. Moreover, international bodies had expressed concern regarding Denmark's approach to family reunification. The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: 1. The applicants, Ms Kremena Goshova Budinova and Mr Vasil Stoyanov Chaprazov, are Bulgarian nationals who were born, respectively, in 1970 and 1945 and live, respectively, in Sofia and Sliven. Ms Budinova is represented before the Court by Ms A. Kachaunova, a lawyer practising in Sofia and working with the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee. Mr Chaprazov is represented before the Court by Mr K. Kanev, chairman of the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee.A. The circumstances of the case2. The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants and emerging from publicly available sources, may be summarised as follows.1. Background to the case3. Ataka is a Bulgarian political party founded in 2005. At the parliamentary elections that year it gained 8.14% of the votes cast and obtained twenty-one seats in Bulgaria\u2019s two-hundred-and-forty-seat Parliament. At the parliamentary elections in 2009 it gained 9.36% of the votes cast and again obtained twenty-one seats. Its figures for the 2013 parliamentary elections were respectively 7.30% of the votes cast and twenty-three seats. At the parliamentary elections in 2014 it gained 4.52% of the votes cast and eleven seats. It presented itself at the 2017 parliamentary elections as part of the coalition \u201cUnited Patriots\u201d, which gained 9.31% of the votes cast, and obtained eight out of the coalition\u2019s twenty-seven seats.4. The party\u2019s leader, Mr Volen Siderov, has been a Member of Parliament for Ataka since 2005. Before that, he worked as a journalist: in the early 1990s as editor-in-chief of the daily Demokratsia; then, in the early 2000s, as a columnist for the daily Monitor; and later as host of the daily television programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired by the television station SKAT. In 2006 he ran for President of Bulgaria. He came second in the first round of voting, obtaining 21.5% of the votes cast, and in the run-off lost against the incumbent, Mr Georgi Parvanov, by 24.05% to 75.95%. In February 2011 Mr Siderov again announced his candidacy for President. At the first round of voting, which took place on 23 October 2011, he obtained 3.64% of the votes cast.5. The applicants described Ataka as a \u201cxenophobic party\u201d and said that in his career as a journalist and politician Mr Siderov had systematically engaged in extreme anti-Roma and more generally anti-minority propaganda, by way of books, articles in Monitor, and then in his television programme, in effect making this his political platform.6. Further information about Ataka\u2019s activities and political positions can be found in Karaahmed v. Bulgaria (no. 30587/13, \u00a7\u00a7 7-27, 24 February 2015).2. The proceedings under the Protection From Discrimination Act 20037. In January 2006 the applicants and sixteen other people, as well as sixty-six non-governmental organisations, brought proceedings against Mr Siderov under section 5 of the Protection From Discrimination Act 2003 (see paragraph 20 below). They alleged that a number of public statements made by him had constituted harassment of, and an incitement to discrimination against, Roma, Turks, Jews, Catholics and sexual minorities.8. The Sofia District Court split the case into eight separate cases, based on the specific badge of discrimination alleged by each group of claimants. The case of the two applicants, both of whom are Roma, concerned Mr Siderov\u2019s statements in relation to Roma.(a) The statements by Mr Siderov at issue in the applicants\u2019 case9. In their claim, the applicants asserted that a number of statements made by Mr Siderov in his television programme, interviews, speeches and a book had amounted to harassment and incitement to discrimination on the basis of Roma ethnic origin. The applicants sought court orders against Mr Siderov to stop making such statements and to restore the status quo ante by publicly apologising for his statements.10. The applicants referred in particular to the following statements by Mr Siderov (arranged in the order they appeared in the particulars of claim):Television programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 1 June 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... Professor [S.K.] died, expired, passed away. The man, beaten to a pulp after a terrorist attack by a Gypsy gang on peaceful Bulgarians staying in their own establishment and having fun. ...... This scientist, Bulgarian, famous, with authority, enjoying a very good name in scientific circles, was killed like a dog by a gang of ferocious Gypsies. With premeditation, wilfully, sadistically ...... This whole genocide, carried out against the Bulgarian community in the \u2018Zaharna Fabrika\u2019 neighbourhood. A genocide committed by an ethnic group of Gypsies. There is in Bulgaria a racial, ethnic discrimination against Bulgarians by the Gypsy ethnos. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 4 June 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... A gang of Gypsies, eighty strong, carried out a terrorist attack against several Bulgarians who were celebrating the prom night of a man from the neighbourhood. People were thrashed in the course of this attack, one of them died. The fifty\u2011three\u2011year-old professor of history [S.K.] died after a beastly sadistic beating. It turned out that the problem was not confined to \u2018Zaharna Fabrika\u2019. This is a problem for the whole of Bulgaria. I have received information about similar happenings from all corners of the country. Some of the stories are harrowing and people say that they live in such fear that they dare not even complain to the police because they would not do anything in response. I got information from the village of Mechka, near Pleven, I have spoken about this village. There, in 2000, [P.T.] was killed in his own yard. Until this day this man\u2019s killers have not been caught, have not been convicted. They are from among the Gypsies from the village\u2019s Gypsy neighbourhood. After this case, it turned out that it was not only this murder that had not been investigated, but there had been seven more, villagers told me. Today they live in a fear that can only be compared with the fear of people living under foreign occupation, trembling each day for their life, for their property. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 7 June 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... And Gypsy terror over Bulgarians is growing literally by the week. ...... This shows that the authorities refuse to deal with Gypsy terror. This is a tremendous problem for Bulgaria. And I am telling you that if the authorities keep on refusing to address the issue, in two-three years, or five, Gypsy terror will become Bulgaria\u2019s foremost problem. But it will then be too late, for Bulgarians will have self-organised and responded to violence with violence. ...... Think very hard, if Euroroma [a political party] enter Parliament, what greater protection will terrorists from Gypsy ghettoes gain. Because the thing they carry out, it is organised terror against Bulgarians. This terror must be brought to a halt. This terror must be resisted. And I promise you that work is being done in that respect. Hard work is being carried out by Bulgarians who can no longer bear the terror on their compatriots and will do all they can for this to cease. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 8 June 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... There is no town, no settlement in Bulgaria that has not borne the brunt of Gypsy terror. ...... I want to tell you also that the question of Gypsy terror can only be resolved by way of tackling, general tackling of this population, putting it where it belongs. They should work, learn to respect the laws, learn to meet their obligations, to pay their taxes and dues. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 14 June 2005,having as its topic \u201cThe Gypsy killers of Professor [K.] are free\u201d\u201c... Gypsy terror in Bulgaria continues. Gypsy terror in Bulgaria has never stopped. Something more, and this has now begun to be acknowledged by international studies, which show that the bulk of the crime in the country \u2013 upwards of 30% \u2013 is being carried out by Gypsies. At the same time, this ethnos amounts to a mere 5% of the general population. So we, Bulgarians, have been subjected to total Gypsy terror. Every day, every hour, in all corners of Bulgaria. ...... An esteemed Bulgarian scientist was killed in a sadistic, barbaric manner by a gang of Gypsies. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 4 May 2005,having as its topic \u201cThe racial discrimination against Bulgarians in Bulgaria\u201d\u201c... At the same time, whole Gypsy neighbourhoods are not only not paying for their electricity but also beat up the fee collectors, attack the police vehicles which try to re-establish order, and thrash everything around them, loot shops, rob people, and nothing is being done to them. When you ask the high command of the police or the State in general why they have not taken any measures, they say \u2013 so as not to provoke an ethnic conflict. So a group of people in Bulgaria \u2013 non-Bulgarians \u2013 is being placed in a privileged position. ... This is called democracy, this is called integration, this is called wonderful names, which however conceal a single thing \u2013 discrimination and genocide against the Bulgarians in Bulgaria. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 6 May 2005\u201c... This huge wave of external and internal factors, which wish, which categorically wish and work to de-Bulgarianise Bulgaria. Work to destroy the Bulgarian nation as a nation. Work for its Gypsification, for its Turkification. Work for everything but the possibility for the Bulgarian people to consist of Bulgarians. I would like to tell you that according to official statistical data more than half of the children born in Bulgaria are either little Turks or little Gypsies. This is because nowadays, with plenty of outside money, anti-Bulgarian factors, aided by national traitors from within, have since long ago worked to separate the Bulgarian people. Work is being done to make Gypsies feel like a separate nationality, to pretend they are apart and to seek collective rights. Work is being done for all sorts of other ... to create all sorts of other invented nationalities in Bulgaria. The results are at hand \u2013 already more than half of all newborns in Bulgaria are not Bulgarian. This means that the de-Bulgarisation process is moving towards its high point, which means towards the end of the Bulgarian nation. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 25 May 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... Today I would like to speak about a topic on which the so-called official media keep silent, and on which politicians keep silent too. This topic is Gypsy terror, the Gypsy terror carried out over Bulgarians in Bulgaria. This is a very serious topic, this is a drastic topic. But most media, as I said, keep silent about this topic. ...... An awful thrashing has taken place in the \u2018Zaharna Fabrika\u2019 neighbourhood over Bulgarians, and more than eighty Gypsies have taken part in it. They thrashed up an establishment, beat up a police officer, beat up the establishment\u2019s owner, beat up the people who were there, and yet I know not of any of them having been arrested. Here, see this material from the front page of Night Trud, the only newspaper that does not shirk from writing about the Gypsy topic, the topic about Gypsy terror over Bulgarians. ...... In this case, in particular, police officers were hurt as well. Though they tried to shoot stop-cartridges in the air, they were attacked and some were hit and beaten up by the Gypsies. This is not the first such case. You recall that a village police officer in a village near Burgas was beaten up \u2013 attacked by a gang of Gypsies. Forest rangers were attacked in Botevgrad and the vicinity. Forest workers were attacked near Samokov. Terror is constantly being generated across Bulgaria. By a population which calls itself \u2018a minority\u2019. Except that in many towns and villages in Bulgaria it is no longer a minority but the majority. There are today hundreds of villages in Bulgaria in which the prevailing population is Gypsy. Not only does it not integrate, something that parrots getting food from foreign foundations talk about, it also terrorises the Bulgarian population there. This terror continues under the benevolent gaze of the ruling clique, which not only does nothing but also stops the law\u2011enforcement authorities from intervening. Usually, when something like this happens, as in the case of this terror over Bulgarian citizens in \u2018Zaharna Fabrika\u2019, then orders come from somewhere high-up for the police not to intervene, for investigators to keep mum, for prosecutors not to sweat too much, and for the judicial system to, like, close its eyes and not put the ruffians, the rapists, the killers, very often of Gypsy origin, in prison. ...... The Bulgarian State nowadays tolerates Gypsy terror against Bulgarians. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 30 May 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... Today I continue with the topic of Gypsy terror. ... These are between 1,500 and 2,000 Gypsies, no-one can say how many exactly, who have come from the whole country, have settled there, without registering their address. All of them are deemed to inhabit the same address \u2013 [...] \u2013 and live there illegally. They do not pay taxes, do not pay fees, do not pay for electricity, do not pay for water supply. They pay for nothing. But what do they do \u2013 they beat up Bulgarians, rob them, ill-treat them, rape women, kill, there have been several murders already. I categorically promise you, dear Bulgarians, that I will investigate these cases, because this is not simply terror, Gypsy terror, as I have entitled my programme, this is genocide. This is to commit genocide against the Bulgarian ethnos in Bulgaria. This genocide is being manipulated and stimulated from abroad. I have information that these Gypsy raids are being paid for, paid so that they be organised and stir up unrest. Someone wishes this place to become like Kosovo. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 22 March 2005,having as its topic \u201cGypsy terror\u201d\u201c... And this is just one episode from the long series of Gypsy violence, which is now an everyday occurrence in the capital. As you can see, we are talking about a central school in the capital, in \u2018Ovcha Kupel\u2019. And what about localities in the countryside, smaller settlements, villages, which are being constantly subjected to Gypsy violence? ...... There are whole regions, dear Bulgarians, where settlements have in the last few years turned from Bulgarian, predominantly Bulgarian, to predominantly Gypsy. Someone would say that this is already a demographic issue. For my part, I say that this is a question of genocide against the Bulgarians, since Gypsy criminality is deliberately not being prosecuted. ...... I must say that during the last few years, the last perhaps seven or eight years, about 102 towns and villages in Bulgaria have turned from predominantly Bulgarian to predominantly Gypsy. This means a conquest of Bulgaria, a Gypsification which will lead to ... I personally dare not paint the picture that might result, because the impudence of those groups, ethnic groups, is growing like an avalanche. ...\u201dTelevision programme \u201cAtaka\u201d aired on 23 June 2004\u201c... We see how in the park \u2013 Borisova Gradina \u2013 the busts of a number of Bulgarian national writers and revolutionaries have gone missing, stolen by Gypsy gangs and melted for recycling. ...\u201dInterview with Mr Siderov aired by SKAT television in June 2005\u201c... I shall not detain people here with details about the dozens of instances of marauding, of crime left simply without repercussions, just because it would cause ethnic unrest, as are now saying the people in power. ... They refuse to take a stance and thus encourage whole groups of people, who simply know that they will not be sanctioned, and do as they please. The examples are dozens. ... Villages, towns are simply squirming under a living terror. And this terror is becoming greater each day, and I believe that this should all be brought to a halt. There is a way to bring it to a halt. These ways ... so, at first they seem violent, administrative, but they are being applied in developed countries. And I shall again point to America, so very beloved by all democrats and liberal-mongering politicians. Where anyone who commits an offence or attacks you in your home, in your property, which is inviolable and sacred by constitution \u2013 you can literally shoot him, protecting your home, and not be held liable. I am categorically in favour of that. I want the Bulgarian to be protected in his own home. To be able to protect his family, his property, and not wonder whether, if he defends himself, he would tomorrow become a target for the judicial system, be branded as a violent offender, as has happened in some cases ...... Gypsification is an enormous problem. It is not such an easy problem. Because I know of no country in Europe which has managed to integrate its Gypsy population, fully and completely. There is no such country. The problem is that in Bulgaria, unlike in a Germany or a France, this population is a serious percentage. There, even if there are Gypsies, they are a lot less in terms of percentage and do not create such a problem. If no measures are taken, and that at State level, as a programme, this problem, I am categorically certain in that, I assure all viewers, all Bulgarians, that this problem will become paramount for Bulgaria in only five-six years. Because this population, let\u2019s say it honestly, directly, understands sanctions. As does, by the way, a serious part of the population of the Earth, when they are subjected to sanctions. And we cannot be confident that self-education, moral scruples will prevail and that one fine day we will see ourselves surrounded by a Gypsy ethnos that will be at a moral level so as to by itself heed all laws and moral precepts. ...\u201dSpeech by Mr Siderov at a pre-election rally of Atakain Burgas on 22 June 2005\u201c... All Gypsy gangs, marauders, who torture, ill-treat, rape and loot in all towns of Bulgaria will be put in their place. ...... Now is the time when we must begin to stop this process of Gypsification of Bulgaria. ...\u201dSpeech by Mr Siderov at the first session ofthe newly elected Parliament on 11 July 2005\u201c... Because a gigantic genocide of the Bulgarian nation was carried out during this eight-year period. At the insistence of foreign factors, hostile to Bulgaria, it is envisaged to leave three-and-a-half to four million from our people. This is the plan of the Bulgarophobes, and this plan is being carried out before our very eyes. If someone asks how, I will point out: by stripping Bulgarians of the right to be masters in their own State, by leaving them to die of misery and lack of medicine and medical treatment, by subjecting them to terror by Gypsy gangs, who every day attack, loot, rape and ill-treat the Bulgarian nation, and then, deliberately, no-one seeks to uncover the crimes committed by them, because the foreign directive is like that \u2013 not to investigate offences committed by these minority groups. The goal is for Bulgarians to live in fear, to lose faith, to be crushed, submissive. ...\u201dInterview with Mr Siderov aired by Darik Radio in July 2005\u201cHost: Now, the other topic \u2013 Roma. How to resolve the problem with illegal logging and Roma?Mr Siderov: ... I know that in this region this is an everyday occurrence, this happens all the time, Gypsies with carts, with saws, with equipment \u2013 quite decent, by the way \u2013 are constantly cutting down, and there is illegal logging going on. ... This is well-known, all know this, just ask around the region, they will tell you. And in the fact that what happened here was a clash between such poaching Gypsies who break the law \u2013 this should be said clearly, no-one has done it until today \u2013 and law\u2011enforcement authorities or forest rangers, I am not sure \u2013 this will surely be elucidated in the future investigation, this is simply the consequence of something that is happening; measures against this illegal logging should have been taken long ago, to put the perpetrators in prison and make it so that they do not think again of cutting down Bulgarian forests, because the damage is dreadful. This damage will not be made good for decades. This is simply an invasion of termites which destroys Bulgaria.Host: This is one side of the medal, Mr Siderov, and would you say that, should it be established that the gendarmerie or the forest rangers or the police have beaten up Gypsies, would you say that they should also be punished?Mr Siderov: If it is established that Gypsies have beaten up \u2013 because I know of a case, in which today or yesterday \u2013 not sure, let me avoid an error \u2013 but a very recent case, in which in Burgas Gypsies attacked fee collectors and beat them up. Fee collectors who were on their way to stop water supply which had not been paid for for three years.Host: They should obviously be punished. And should those who beat up Gypsies likewise be punished?Mr Siderov: Those who lay their hands on a law-enforcement officer should be punished with the full severity of the law. I am simply categorically in favour of that. In the case of this gendarmerie, I fully excuse the actions of the gendarmerie there, because in this case specifically we have a crime, we have illegal logging, we have an offence that has gone on for years. It was, you know, high time for the gendarmerie to intervene. I am for that.Host: ... And yet, should Gypsies be beaten up in ... when they are being arrested?Mr Siderov: This is not a correct question, because what is \u2018should they be\u2019 supposed to mean? Offences should be prevented ...Host: Do you approve of violence against Gypsies?Mr Siderov: If offenders put up resistance, they should be neutralised, including by force. This is the law. So there must have been some resistance, because there is more than one case in which Gypsies have attacked police officers, have attacked law\u2011enforcement officers; there were police officers, patrols, and so on, who had been beaten up. This is inadmissible, in each civilised country such people are simply neutralised on the spot, the very second, by all possible means. And this is absolutely lawful, within the bounds of the law.Host: And do you approve, because there were even such cases against Bulgaria in Strasbourg, the thrashing of Gypsies in investigation facilities? When they have already been caught, do not put up resistance \u2013 they are being tied up and beaten up.Mr Siderov: And I would ask you: do you approve of an attack on a law\u2011enforcement officer by a poacher, a law-breaker, a criminal?Host: If we are to remain on humorous terrain \u2013 you are adamant to preserve your image.Mr Siderov: ... I am against Strasbourg\u2019s decision. If someone approves of a police officer being attacked, I, according to me ... my personal opinion is that he should have permission and the right to shoot to kill in such cases, because this is how law\u2011enforcement authorities operate. This is how it is in America, this how it is, you know, in developed countries \u2013 the police are inviolable \u2013 they cannot be attacked, especially by someone who is committing an offence. This is the same as ... he should become a target for the police officer, for the law-enforcement officer who is doing his duty, and be neutralised, including by using firearms. ...\u201dPassages from Mr Siderov\u2019s book \u201cBulgarophobia\u201d,published in Sofia in 2003\u201c... They steal out of poverty, say the waged human-rights defenders, they have no jobs. They skip over the tiny fact that Gypsy families retain their children from school en masse and they remain illiterate. What kind of work can they get later? If you offer them agricultural work, they balk. They prefer to steal the fruit. To steal wires and scavenge all things made of metal. According to villagers, it is chiefly Gypsies who now burn the forests, so that they can smuggle wood after that. ...\u201d (at p. 288)\u201c... According to the statistics, unemployment benefits in Bulgaria are distributed as follows: 65.2% of the money goes for Roma, 14.6% for Bulgarians. Again, the few Bulgarians in active working age who remain in Bulgaria support a gigantic percentage of Gypsies who for their part only use benefits, do not pay, and are on top of everything the main thieves of electricity wires, which has caused the State losses of hundreds of millions and is everywhere treated as terrorism, but we are broad\u2011minded. If this is untrue, let the police and the investigators who deal with electric-wire theft rebut me. ...\u201d (at p. 315)\u201c... Throughout all those years, when Gypsies-bandits stole away, cut tons of electric wires, which in civilised countries is a terrorist act, and left whole regions without electricity, causing millions of levs in damages, non-Gypsies were hanging themselves from the ceiling out of despair ...\u201d (at p. 332)\u201c... The brazenness of demonstrative Gypsy banditry comes from statements such as that of the leader of the Roma Association [T.T.] made before the newspaper Trud on 14 August 2001: \u2018Bulgaria will become Kosovo\u2019. The prophecy (or threat) of the Roma leader is evidently turning into a reality. In the absence of State authority in Bulgaria, the next stage is terrorist acts and murders of non-Gypsies. \u2018What are we to do?\u2019 asks hopelessly the police chief in Plovdiv. Our advice is, first tender your resignation. And until then let someone who knows how to deal with terrorists and street vandals take the post. ... \u201d (at p. 333)(b) The course of the proceedings in the applicants\u2019 case(i) At first instance11. On 15 October 2008 the Sofia District Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 claim. It began by noting that the case turned on whether Mr Siderov\u2019s statements had been a proper exercise of his right to freedom to express an opinion, guaranteed by Article 39 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution (see paragraph 18 below), or whether they had amounted to an exercise of that right with a view to fomenting ethnic strife. The court went on to say that the assertion that the impugned statements had constituted harassment or incitement to discrimination were not supported by the facts. The statements, though revealing a negative attitude towards Roma as a group, had not meant to place them at a disadvantage vis-\u00e0-vis other ethnic groups, but rather the opposite, as they contained appeals that Roma be treated on an equal footing with other Bulgarian citizens. It was true that the statements, which touched upon the integration of Roma, had been phrased in a way which could not be reconciled with a correct tone and the need for tolerance when discussing issues of public importance. But this was not in itself indicative of incitement to discrimination, since that hinged on a statement\u2019s content rather than its form or wording. Mr Siderov had, whether this had been justified or not, sought to focus the public\u2019s attention on \u201cthe fact that certain ethnic minority groups commit[ted] offences against the person, which remained without punishment, and [did] not fulfil their obligations, as was expected of all Bulgarian citizens, namely not to disrupt public order and to pay their debts to the State and the various utility companies\u201d. Calls for the investigation and punishment of offences committed by the members of one or another ethnic group, and for them to abide by the laws, did not amount to discrimination, but were rather directed towards the equal treatment of the members of the various ethnic groups. Accepting that ethnicity could be grounds to treat an individual or a group differently and to waive their criminal and civil liability would amount to legitimising discrimination against people with a different ethnic self-consciousness, which was proscribed by the Constitution and the 2003 Act. Mr Siderov\u2019s public manifestation of his negative views about the conduct of the Roma community did not in itself amount to discrimination, since his statements were not intended to place that community in a less favourable position, but called for \u2013 as was indeed required by law \u2013 equal treatment (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u043e\u0442 15.10.2008 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 2858/2006 \u0433., \u0421\u0420\u0421).(ii) On appeal12. The applicants and the four other claimants in the case appealed, arguing that the court\u2019s findings were formalistic and contrary to common sense. When a politician publicly spoke of an ethnic group using such crude terms, he in effect instilled fear and hatred towards it. It was not necessary for him directly to call for violence or discrimination against it. By holding otherwise, the court had erred in the application of the 2003 Act. Also, by referring to Mr Siderov\u2019s assertions as a \u201cfact\u201d, it had itself displayed racial bias.13. On 21 June 2010 the Sofia City Court upheld the lower court\u2019s judgment. It held that the available evidence did not permit a conclusion that the impugned statements had subjected the applicants to differential treatment vis-\u00e0-vis the rest of the population, or had constituted harassment or incitement to discrimination. Mr Siderov had not in his publications, his public statements made over a considerable period of time, or his speech in Parliament in 2005 directly or wilfully encouraged discrimination based on Roma ethnicity. In particular, his remark in the book \u201cBulgarophobia\u201d that the inhabitants of a Roma neighbourhood owed six million Bulgarian levs to the electricity company and that no steps were being taken to collect that debt could not be qualified as harassment (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 2935 \u043e\u0442 21.06.2010 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0432. \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 2703/2010 \u0433., \u0421\u0413\u0421).(iii) Before the Supreme Court of Cassation14. The applicants and the four other claimants in the case appealed on points of law. They argued that the Sofia City Court had failed to give cogent reasons and properly to analyse Mr Siderov\u2019s statements in the light of the definitions of harassment and incitement to discrimination in the 2003 Act. They again emphasised that he was a well-known politician who had actively sought to vilify a whole ethnic group.15. On 8 August 2012 the Supreme Court of Cassation refused to admit the appeal for consideration. It held that there was no indication that there was divergent case-law in relation to the points at issue in the case, or that it threw up special issues relating to the correct application of the law or its development (see \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 972 \u043e\u0442 08.08.2012 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 1672/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, IV \u0433. \u043e.).B. Relevant domestic law and practice1. Constitutional provisions16. Article 6 \u00a7 2 of the 1991 Constitution provides for equality before the law in the following terms:\u201cAll citizens shall be equal before the law. There shall be no restrictions of rights or privileges on grounds of race, nationality, ethnic identity, sex, origin, religion, education, opinions, political affiliations, or personal, social or property status.\u201d17. Article 32 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution enshrines the right to protection of one\u2019s private life and dignity in the following terms:\u201cCitizens\u2019 private life shall be inviolable. All shall be entitled to protection against unlawful interferences with their private ... life and against infringements of their honour, dignity or good name.\u201d18. Article 39 \u00a7 1 of the Constitution provides that everyone is entitled to express an opinion and publicise it through words, whether written or oral, sounds or images, or in any other way. By Article 39 \u00a7 2, this right must not be \u201cexercised to the detriment of the rights and reputation of others, or for incitement to ... enmity or violence against anyone\u201d.2. Protection From Discrimination Act 2003(a) The prohibitions against discrimination and harassment(i) Statutory provisions19. The Protection From Discrimination Act was enacted in 2003 and came into force on 1 January 2004. It prohibits, in section 4(1), any direct or indirect discrimination on the basis of gender, race, nationality, ethnicity, human genome, citizenship, origin, religion or belief, education, convictions, political affiliation, personal or social status, disability, age, sexual orientation, marital status, property status, or any other grounds laid down in statute or an international treaty to which Bulgaria is party.20. By section 5, harassment based on any of the grounds under section 4(1), as well as sexual harassment, or incitement to discrimination, persecution and racial segregation, is deemed to be discrimination.21. Paragraph 1(1) of the additional provisions defines \u201charassment\u201d as any unwanted conduct motivated by the grounds in section 4(1), whether expressed through physical gestures, words or otherwise, which is either meant to infringe or results in infringing the dignity of the people concerned and the creation of an intimidating, hostile, degrading, humiliating or offensive environment. Paragraph 1(5) defines \u201cincitement to discrimination\u201d as direct and wilful encouragement, instructions, pressure or coaxing to carry out discrimination.22. The Supreme Administrative Court has explained that direct discrimination and harassment are related but nevertheless distinct notions, a difference in treatment being irrelevant in relation to harassment, which is rather characterised by its special aim or result, as set out in paragraph 1(1) (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 8105 \u043e\u0442 08.06.2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 8708/2010 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, VII \u043e., upheld by \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 156 \u043e\u0442 05.01.2012 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 13389/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441-\u0432).(ii) Case-law relating to public statements about Roma as a group23. In a March 2009 judgment, upheld on appeal in December 2009, the Supreme Administrative Court found that statements by a mayor in a radio interview that \u201ceven cows in [his municipality] would obstruct less than a Gypsy neighbourhood\u201d and that \u201csuch a Roma neighbourhood wold be ten times more dangerous than a rubbish dump in the proximity of living quarters\u201d had amounted to harassment within the meaning of the above provisions as they had infringed the dignity of a large number of people and had created an insulting environment based on ethnicity. The fact that the mayor had expressed his opinion in relation to a public-policy issue could not justify his comparing a minority ethnic group to \u201ccows\u201d and a \u201crubbish dump\u201d. Nor was it a defence that the mayor had not meant to offend the people concerned; it was enough that his words, which had been widely publicised in the Roma community, had led to that result (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 3019 \u043e\u0442 06.03.2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 9485/2008 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, VII \u043e., upheld by \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 14472 \u043e\u0442 01.12.2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 11158/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441-\u0432).24. In a July 2009 judgment, upheld on appeal in February 2010, the same court held that a television programme portraying Roma as prone to anti-social behaviour could lead to negative stereotypes and thus fell under the prohibition in section 5 of the 2003 Act without being capable of being justified on freedom-of-expression grounds. This was so in view of, in particular, the special duties and responsibilities of journalists and the widely held prejudice against Roma (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 9983 \u043e\u0442 23.07.2009 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 2059/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, VII \u043e., upheld by \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 1476 \u043e\u0442 04.02.2010 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 14286/2009 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, \u043f\u0435\u0442\u0447\u043b. \u0441-\u0432).25. In a March 2016 judgment the same court held that by using a derogatory term with respect to Roma in the name of a computer file, a computer specialist employed by the presidential administration had committed harassment under paragraph 1(1) of the 2003 Act (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 2445 \u043e\u0442 02.03.2016 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 1248/2015 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.).26. By contrast, in a final January 2019 judgment the same court held that a statement by the Vice-Prime Minister in Parliament in which he had referred to offences committed by Roma in negative terms had amounted to a legitimate exercise of his freedom of expression (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 636 \u043e\u0442 15.01.2019 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0430\u0434\u043c. \u0434. \u2116 7229/2018 \u0433., \u0412\u0410\u0421, V \u043e.).(b) Proceedings before the Commission for Protection From Discrimination and follow-up claims for damages27. The authority chiefly responsible for ensuring compliance with the 2003 Act is the Commission for Protection From Discrimination (section 40). It can act of its own motion or pursuant to complaints by the aggrieved parties or reports by concerned persons or authorities (section 50). If the Commission finds a breach of the Act, it can order that it be averted or stopped, or that the status quo ante be restored (section 47(2)). It can also impose sanctions, such as fines, order coercive measures, or give compulsory directions (section 47(3) and (4)). The Commission\u2019s decisions are amenable to judicial review (sections 68(1) and 84(2)).28. People who have obtained a favourable decision by the Commission and wish to obtain compensation for damage suffered as a result of the breach established by it can then bring a claim for damages against the persons or authorities that have caused the damage (section 74(1)).(c) Proceedings before the civil courts29. Those complaining of discrimination can, alternatively, directly bring proceedings in the civil courts and seek declaratory or injunctive relief or damages (section 71(1)(1)-(1)(3)). The claim can be brought on behalf of the aggrieved party by a non-governmental organisation (section 71(2)). If the alleged discrimination has affected many people, the non-governmental organisation can even bring the claim in its own name, in which case those directly affected can join the proceedings as third parties (section 71(3)).30. The Plovdiv Court of Appeal has held that the rights of action under section 71(1)(1) and (1)(2) are strictly personal and cannot be pursued by the heirs of the alleged discrimination\u2019s direct victim (see \u0440\u0435\u0448. \u2116 177 \u043e\u0442 06.04.2011 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u2116 82/2010 \u0433., \u041f\u0410\u0421, appeal on points of law not admitted by \u043e\u043f\u0440. \u2116 156 \u043e\u0442 03.02.2012 \u0433. \u043f\u043e \u0433\u0440. \u0434. \u21161004/2011 \u0433., \u0412\u041a\u0421, III \u0433. \u043e.).COMPLAINTS31. The applicants complain under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention that by dismissing their claim against Mr Siderov the courts in effect legitimised his statements.32. The applicants also complain under Articles 6 and 14 of the Convention that by dismissing the claim against Mr Siderov and by referring to his assertions as a \u201cfact\u201d the Sofia District Court, whose judgment was upheld by the courts above, in effect legitimised Mr Siderov\u2019s racist attitudes, displayed racial bias, denied the applicants a fair trial, and discriminated against them..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case.

Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment.

Due to his state of insanity, the applicant could not be held criminally liable. The Supreme Court therefore ordered him placed in a psychiatric hospital, without a fixed timeframe. Moreover, he was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.Subsequent to a request by the psychiatric hospital in 2013 that the measure should be replaced by outpatient psychiatric treatment, the applicant, by virtue of section 50 a of the Aliens Act, requested the expulsion order revoked due to his state of health. He maintained that he would not be able to obtain the required psychiatric treatment in Turkey. By decision of 14 October 2014, the City Court revoked the expulsion order. On appeal, on 13 January 2015, the High Court refused to revoke the expulsion order. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused on 20 May 2015.The applicant complained that the decision to refuse to revoke the order expelling him from Denmark was in breach of Articles 3 or 8 of the Convention, notably due to his state of health..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

They are represented before the Court by Mr John Halford, Mr Ben Emmerson QC, Mr Michael Fordham QC, Mr Alex Bailin and Mr John Halford.The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants and as found by the domestic courts, may be summarised as follows.1. The demonstration at Oxford Circus on 1 May 2001On 18 June 1999, 30 November 1999 and 1 May 2000, demonstrations had been held in London to protest against global capitalism which had led to violence and serious breakdowns in public order.For 1 May 2001, two events had been notified to the police, namely a trade union May Day March and Rally and a Young Socialist Students March, taking place in different parts of London. In addition, intelligence indicated that activists representing a broad coalition of environmentalist, anarchist and left wing protest groups intended to stage various protests based on the locations from the Monopoly board game. The locations were very widely spread. They included: CHARM at Marylebone and Liverpool Street stations at 7.30 a.m.; a picket in front of the World Patent Protection Summit at 8 to 10 a.m. in Great Queen Street WC1; a demonstration at 8.30 a.m. in the Pall Mall area against the arms trade; an investiture between 8.30 a.m. and 1 p.m. at Buckingham Palace; a Veggie Burger Give away at King\u2019s Cross McDonalds at 9.30 a.m.; a \u201cPeacenik in the Park\u201d event at Victoria Embankment Gardens; Anti-Capitalist Anti-Globalisation demonstration at Parliament Square and Speakers\u2019 Corner, Hyde Park, at 11 a.m.; an event timed to coincide with the Changing of the Guards at Buckingham Palace at 11.30 a.m.; demonstrations outside Coutts Bank on the Strand, at Elephant and Castle and at Trafalgar Square at 12 noon; further events at Piccadilly Circus at 1 p.m. as well as a protest peacefully to protect the planet at Angel Islington and a protest against hoteliers in West Cromwell Road; four events were due to take place between 2 and 2.30 p.m., at Pentonville prison, Speakers\u2019 Corner, Conduit Street and the Haymarket. The final event was to be a rally at Oxford Circus at 4 p.m. The organisers of the \u201cMay Day Monopoly\u201d protest did not make any contact with the police nor attempt to seek authorisation for the demonstrations.During the domestic proceedings, there was no challenge to, or doubt cast upon, the accuracy and reliability of the intelligence on which police operations on May Day 2001 were based. The police had a Special Branch assessment which was one of the most pessimistic ever seen in London with regard to the risks and seriousness of anticipated public disorder. Special Branch intelligence reported that there would be \u201c500 to 1,000 hard core demonstrators looking for confrontation, violence and to cause public disorder\u201d. The intelligence assessment that there would be such violence and disorder was supported by the lack of co-operation on the part of the organisers, the wearing of masks by demonstrators, the incitement to looting and violence in the organisers\u2019 literature, the suggestion of multiple protests to evade the police and the encouragement of secrecy. The police considered that there was a real risk of serious injury and even death, as well as damage to property, if they did not effectively control the crowd. Those at risk included members of the public, police officers and other demonstrators.The police plan for the day involved the deployment of nearly 6,000 officers on foot wearing high visibility jackets. The policemen and women responsible for policing on May Day 2001 were the most experienced public order officers in England. Since it was foreseen that the final event would be a gathering at Oxford Circus at 4 p.m., a speaker system was installed there. The strategic intentions of the police operation were stated as being to provide public reassurance and ensure public safety; facilitate and police all legitimate protest; prevent public disorder and protect key buildings such as Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament; prevent crime and take all reasonable steps to apprehend offenders if crime was committed; and generally minimise disruption. However, the police had little idea of what to expect or how they would react to it if and when it happened.At around 1 p.m. on 1 May 2001 demonstrators started gathering outside the offices of the World Bank in the Haymarket. They walked towards Piccadilly Circus then down Regent Street to Oxford Circus. By 2 p.m. it was estimated that there were over 1,500 people in Oxford Circus and that more were steadily joining them. The evidence before the domestic courts was that the size of this crowd took the police by surprise and that there were insufficient officers in the area to prevent people gathering in Oxford Circus. Instead the police, fearing public disorder, took the decision at approximately 2 p.m. to contain the crowd. The domestic courts found that, in order to prevent the risk of injury to persons and damage to property, the police had no alternative at 2 p.m. but to impose an absolute cordon at Oxford Circus. The decision to impose the cordon was made in conscious exercise of common law powers to prevent a breach of the peace.Once the decision to contain was taken it took about ten minutes to put in place a loose cordon and about 20-25 minutes to establish a full cordon. It was not possible to contain the crowd selectively, since police officers had no way of distinguishing between demonstrators and non-demonstrators or between peaceful and potentially violent demonstrators.At 2.25 p.m., the Chief Superintendent commanding the operation started to plan for, and put in place, resources to facilitate a commencement of a controlled dispersal. At 2.45pm he expected the release to start within about an hour, but this proved impossible. On at least three occasions during the afternoon the order was given to commence a controlled dispersal north, but had to be reversed or suspended because of the conduct of protestors either inside or outside the cordon. The delay in the dispersal was substantially contributed to by the attitude of the crowd within the cordon which was not co-operating with the police. While about 60% remained calm, about 40% were actively hostile, pushing and throwing missiles. Those who were not pushing or throwing missiles were not dissociating themselves from the minority who were. Some members of the crowd were very violent. They broke up paving slabs and threw the debris at the police. The crowd did nothing to help the police when they entered the cordon to arrest a suspect. It was a dynamic, chaotic and confusing situation. It was made all the more difficult by the fact that there were a large number of protesters in the immediate vicinity outside the cordon. They were engaged in the same quest for Oxford Circus that had driven the original crowd there at 2 p.m. and were refusing to accept control by the police.At 4 p.m. the first announcement was made, telling the people within the cordon that they were being contained to prevent a breach of the peace. It was accepted by the Police Commander in evidence before the domestic courts that the announcement to the crowd could have been made earlier, perhaps at 3.15 or 3.30 p.m.There was sufficient space within the cordon for people to walk about and there was no crushing. But conditions within it were uncomfortable. The weather was cold and wet. No food or water was provided and there was no access to toilet facilities or shelter.When the police eventually began to release the crowd they did so slowly. Protesters were searched and photographed on leaving and the dispersal was not completed until about 9.30 p.m. The domestic courts found that it would not have been practicable for the police to release the crowd collectively earlier than they did, because of the risk of disorder and violence, and also found that the dispersal procedure followed had been reasonable.2. The applicantsa. The first applicantThe first applicant, Lois Austin, is a member of the Socialist Party and had been on many demonstrations, including previous May Day demonstrations. On 1 May 2001 she left her 11 month-old daughter at a cr\u00e8che, planning to collect her at 4.30 p.m., and travelled from Essex to Central London with her partner. They attended the protest against globalisation outside the World Bank before walking with other protestors to Oxford Circus, arriving at about 2 p.m. Around 3.45 p.m. Ms Austin needed to leave the demonstration to collect her daughter from the cr\u00e8che. She explained her situation to two police officers maintaining the cordon and offered the telephone number of the cr\u00e8che for verification. However, she was told that she could not leave and that it was not known how long she would be held. Ms Austin was anxious about her daughter and at 4.30 p.m. she and her partner again requested to be released. The police officer responded: \u201cYou only have yourselves to blame for not being able to leave the demonstration. You should have thought of this and the consequences before coming on a demonstration.\u201dMs Austin arranged for a friend to collect the child from the cr\u00e8che. She was finally released at about 9.30 p.m. During the proceedings before the High Court the judge held that the evidence showed that Ms Austin was stimulated rather than distressed by the event. At various times in the afternoon she had a megaphone and told people not to push. She was in the company of friends throughout. When she came out of the police cordon she did not rush home but participated in a television interview and responded to questions from the press.b. The second applicantBetween 2 and 2.30 p.m. on 1 May 2001 the second applicant attempted to cross Oxford Circus to go to a bookshop on Oxford Street. He was told by a police officer that he could not walk down Oxford street because of the approaching crowd of demonstrators and was advised to take Margaret Street, a parallel road to the north. The applicant followed this advice but between Margaret Street and Regent Street he was met by a wall of riot police with shields and helmets, moving south. The applicant was forced into Oxford Circus at about 2.30 p.m. He immediately asked to be released and was informed that there was an exit for non-protestors at the Bond Street side of Oxford Circus, but when he went there he was told that there was no exit. The applicant was not released until 9.20 p.m.c. The third applicantThe third applicant had no connection with the demonstration. She worked in the Oxford Circus area and was on her lunch break at 2.10 p.m. when she was prevented from returning to her workplace by a line of police officers blocking the road. She turned and tried to pass in another direction but found that that exit was also now blocked by police officers, who began to advance towards her. Ms Lowenthal was held within the cordon at Oxford Circus until 9.35 p.m. She and others repeatedly requested to be released but was told by the policemen she approached that they were under orders to allow no-one to pass.d. The fourth applicantThe fourth applicant also worked in the Oxford Circus area and was also caught up in the cordon while walking through Oxford Circus on his lunch break. He was released at approximately 8 p.m.3. The domestic proceedings brought by the first applicanta. The High CourtOn 29 April 2002 the first applicant issued proceedings against the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, claiming damages for false imprisonment and for a breach of her rights under Articles 5, 10 and 11 of the Convention.It was Ms Austin\u2019s case that she was not herself presenting a threat to the peace and that any action taken against her as a result of the conduct of others had to come within the established limits of the common law power of police officers to deal with a breach of the peace and be justified under Article 5. The Commissioner of Police accepted that the applicant was not violent and had not herself threatened violence nor breached the peace nor threatened to do so. As to whether the applicant\u2019s rights under Article 5 had been violated, the Commissioner\u2019s case was that the applicant had not been deprived of her liberty within the meaning of Article 5 \u00a7 1 or, in the alternative, if she was deprived of her liberty, that the deprivation had been lawful in accordance with Article 5 \u00a7 1(c). In relation to Articles 10 and 11, the Commissioner argued that the interferences pursued the aim of preventing disorder and crime and did so proportionately.In the High Court judgment delivered on 23 March 2005 ([2005] EWHC 480 (QB)), Tugendhat J dismissed the applicant\u2019s claims. On the basis of his findings of fact, the judge found that a breach of the peace had been imminent at the time the containment was imposed, that the police had had reasonable grounds to suspect that everyone within the cordon posed a threat to the peace and that the police action throughout had been necessary to prevent such a breach. The detention was, accordingly, justified for the purpose of the tort of false imprisonment as a lawful exercise of traditional breach of the peace powers.In connection with Article 5, the judge found that Ms Austin had been deprived of her liberty but that it had been permissible under Article 5 \u00a7 1(c). Although he found that there was never an intention on the part of the police to bring everyone contained at Oxford Circus before a judge, the purpose was to contain the crowd so that the police could arrest and bring before a judge all those they reasonably considered had committed offences and those whose arrest was necessary to prevent them committing offences.b. The Court of AppealMs Austin was granted permission by the trial judge to appeal to the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner of Police maintained his primary case in relation to Article 5 \u00a7 1, that the applicant had not been subjected to a deprivation of liberty, but he also argued in the alternative that the deprivation of liberty was justified under Article 5 \u00a7 1(c) and (b).In a judgment delivered on 15 October 2007 ([2007] EWCA Civ 989), the Court of Appeal dismissed the first applicant\u2019s appeal, on grounds which differed from those of the High Court. In connection with the claim for false imprisonment, the Court of Appeal held that, in order to prevent a breach of the peace threatened by others, the police could lawfully take action which interfered with or curtailed the lawful exercise of the rights of innocent third parties, but only where all other possible steps had been taken to avoid a breach of the peace and to protect the rights of third parties and where the action taken was reasonably necessary and proportionate. Applying this test, in the circumstances of the demonstration at Oxford Circus, Ms Austin\u2019s containment was lawful because it was necessary to prevent an imminent breach of the peace by others.In connection with the claim under Article 5, the Court of Appeal concluded that the detention did not amount to a deprivation of liberty, commenting that:\u201cit would be surprising if the respondent infringed the appellants\u2019 rights under article 5 in a case where the judge has held that it was necessary for the police to take the steps they did\u201d.They emphasised the need under the Convention to strike a fair balance between the general interest of the community and the requirement of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights and continued:\u201c94. ... The appropriate balance could be met by concluding that there was here no deprivation of the appellants\u2019 liberty under article 5(1), or by holding that there was a deprivation of their liberty but either that it was lawful in order to secure the fulfilment of an obligation prescribed by law within article 5(1)(b) or was within article 5(1)(c). Because of its general approach, it does seem to us that, if the [Court] were to hold that there was a deprivation of the appellants\u2019 liberty, it would be inclined to hold that paragraph (b) or (c) applied in order to ensure that the balance enshrined in the purpose of the Convention was maintained. We stress that we are here concerned with a most unusual case on the facts, in which the judge has held that the police had no real alternative to doing what they did\u201d.The Court of Appeal found that the imposition of the containment at the outset was not markedly different from other measures which would plainly not amount to a deprivation of liberty such as holding back football supporters to avoid crowd violence or preventing motorists from leaving a motorway. As with these sorts of cases \u201cthe original imposition of the cordon could not ... properly be regarded as the kind of arbitrary detention which the Strasbourg authorities would describe as deprivation of liberty within the meaning of article 5(1)\u201d (\u00a7 103).c. The House of LordsThe applicant was granted leave to appeal by the House of Lords in connection with the issues under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the Convention. The case was heard on 24 and 25 November 2008 and on 28 January 2009 a unanimous judgment was delivered, dismissing the appeal on the ground that Article 5 \u00a7 1 did not apply since the applicant had not been deprived of her liberty ([2009] UKHL 5).Lord Hope of Craighead, with whom all the other Law Lords agreed, explained his approach to the interpretation of \u201cdeprivation of liberty\u201d as follows:\u201cThe threshold17. If the difference between a restriction of liberty and a deprivation of liberty was to be measured merely by the duration of the restriction, it would be hard to regard what happened in this case as anything other than a deprivation of liberty. The interference with the appellant\u2019s freedom of movement was not merely transitory, as in R (Gillan) v Commissioner of the Police of the Metropolis [2006] UKHL 12; [2006] 2 AC 307 where detention in the exercise of stop and search powers would ordinarily be for a few minutes only. In this case the detention that resulted from the police cordon was measured in hours, not minutes. But it is very well established that, in order to determine whether the threshold has been crossed, a much wider examination of the facts and circumstances is appropriate. In Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHRR 647, para 59, for example, the court said that a disciplinary measure which would unquestionably be deemed a deprivation of liberty were it to be applied to a civilian might not possess that characteristic when applied to a serviceman. But it would not escape the terms of article 5 if it deviated from the normal conditions of life within the armed forces of the Contracting States. In order to establish whether this was so, account should be taken of a whole range of factors such as the nature, duration, effects and manner of execution of the penalty or measure in question.18. In Guzzardi v Italy (1980) 3 EHRR 333, where the applicant was sent for three years to live under special supervision on a small island, the court decided by a majority of 11 votes to 7 that he had been deprived of his liberty, both the majority and the minority were agreed that the question was one of degree. In para 92 of its judgment, following Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHRR 647, para 59, the court said that, in order to determine whether someone has been \u2018deprived of his liberty\u2019 within the meaning of article 5, the starting point must be his concrete situation and that account must be taken of a whole range of criteria, such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question. In para 93 however it added these words:\u2018The difference between deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is nonetheless merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance. Although the process of classification into one or other of these categories sometimes proves to be no easy task in that some borderline cases are a matter of pure opinion, the court cannot avoid making the selection upon which the applicability or inapplicability of article 5 depends.\u2019The point that is being made in the first sentence of para 93, which the court has repeated in many subsequent cases, is that it is not enough that what was done could be said in general or colloquial terms to have amounted to a deprivation of liberty. Except in the paradigm case of close confinement in a prison cell, where there is no room for argument, the absolute nature of the right requires a more exacting examination of the relevant criteria. There is a threshold that must be crossed before this can be held to amount to a breach of article 5(1). Whether it has been crossed must be measured by the degree or intensity of the restriction....22. This case however is not simply a threshold case. It raises a more fundamental issue of principle which was not dealt with in Guzzardi v Italy (1980) 3 EHRR 333. Is it relevant, when considering whether a case falls within the ambit of article 5(1), to have regard to the purpose for which a person\u2019s freedom of movement has been restricted? If so, in what kinds of cases can this be relevant? And, if the purpose of the restriction is relevant, what conditions must it satisfy to avoid being proscribed by the article?23. The application of article 5(1) to measures of crowd control is an issue which does not appear so far to have been brought to the attention of the court in Strasbourg. So there is no direct guidance as to whether article 5(1) is engaged where the police impose restrictions on movement for the sole purpose of protecting people from injury or avoiding serious damage to property. The need for measures of crowd control to be adopted in the public interest is not new, however. It is frequently necessary, for example, for such measures to be imposed at football matches to ensure that rival fans do not confront each other in situations that may lead to violence. Restrictions on movement may also be imposed by the police on motorists in the interests of road safety after an accident on a motorway, or to prevent local residents from coming too close to a fire or a terrorist incident. It is not without interest that it has not so far been suggested that restrictions of that kind will breach article 5(1) so long as they are proportionate and not arbitrary....Is purpose relevant?26. The decision whether there was deprivation of liberty is, of course, highly sensitive to the facts of each case. Little value can be derived therefore from decisions on the application of article 5 that depend entirely on their own facts. But they are of value where they can be said to illustrate issues of principle. In the present context some assistance is to be derived from the cases as to the extent to which regard can be had to the aim or purpose of the measure in question when consideration is being given as to whether it is within the ambit of article 5(1) at all.27. If purpose is relevant, it must be to enable a balance to be struck between what the restriction seeks to achieve and the interests of the individual. The proposition that there is a balance to be struck at the initial stage when the scope of the article is being considered was not mentioned in Engel v The Netherlands (No 1) (1976) 1 EHRR 647 or Guzzardi v Italy (1980) 3 EHRR 333. Nor can it be said to be based on anything that is to be found in the wording of the article. But I think that there are sufficient indications elsewhere in the court\u2019s case law that the question of balance is inherent in the concepts that are enshrined in the Convention and that they have a part to play when consideration is being given to the scope of the first rank of fundamental rights that protect the physical security of the individual.28. In X v Federal Republic of Germany (1981) 24 DR 158, where the Commission had regard to the fact that the purpose for which the children were taken to the police headquarters and kept there for about two hours was to question them, not to arrest or detain them. This led to the conclusion that the action in question did not constitute a deprivation of liberty in the sense of article 5(1). Similarly, in Guenat v Switzerland, application no 24722/94, 10 April 1995, the Commission had regard, in reaching its decision that the application was manifestly unfounded, to the fact that the police acted out of humanitarian considerations, given the applicant\u2019s strange behaviour, when they took him to the police station where he remained for nearly three hours and was never locked up as there was never any question of arresting him. And in HM v Switzerland (2002) 38 EHRR 314 the court, in holding that article 5(1) was not applicable, had regard to the fact that applicant was placed in a foster home in her own interests in order to provide her with the necessary medical care, as well as satisfactory living conditions and hygiene: para 48. It would seem in principle that the more intensive the measure and the longer the period it is kept in force the greater will be the need for it to be justified by reference to the purpose of the restriction if it is not to fall within the ambit of the article.29. In Nielsen v Denmark (1988) 11 EHRR 175 the applicant, who was a minor, complained about his committal to a child psychiatric ward of a state hospital at his mother\u2019s request. The question was whether this was a deprivation of his liberty in violation of article 5. The applicant said that it was, as the ward in which he was placed was a closed ward, he was unable to receive visitors except with the agreement of the staff, special permission was required for him to make telephone calls and for persons outside the hospital to get into contact with him and he was under almost constant surveillance: para 65. On those facts his situation was close to the paradigm case ... But the court said in para 72 that it did not follow that the case fell within the ambit of article 5. The restrictions that were imposed on the applicant were not of a nature or degree similar to the cases of deprivation of liberty specified in article 5(1). He was not detained as a person of unsound mind so as to bring the case within paragraph (e). He was there at the request of his mother, as to whom there was no evidence of bad faith. The court summed the matter up in this way in para 72:\u2018Hospitalisation was decided upon by her in accordance with expert medical advice. It must be possible for a child like the applicant to be admitted to hospital at the request of the holder of parental rights, a case which is clearly not covered by paragraph (1) of article 5.\u201930. In Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439 one of the applicant\u2019s complaints was that the decision to extradite him to the United States of America, if implemented, would give rise to a breach of article 3 as, if he were to be sentenced to death, he would be exposed to inhuman and degrading treatment on death row. In para 89 the court stressed the need for a fair balance to be struck:\u2018What amounts to \u2018inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\u2019 depends on all the circumstances of the case. Furthermore, inherent in the whole of the Convention is a search for a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. As movement about the world becomes easier and crime takes on a larger international dimension, it is increasingly in the interest of all nations that suspected offenders who flee abroad should be brought to justice. Conversely, the establishment of safe havens for fugitives would not only result in danger for the State obliged to harbour the protected person but also tend to undermine the foundations of extradition. These considerations must also be included among the factors to be taken into account in the interpretation and application of the notions of inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment in extradition cases.\u201931. In O\u2019Halloran and Francis v United Kingdom (2007) 46 EHRR 397 drivers whose vehicles had been caught on a speed camera complained under article 6(1) that they had been compelled to give incriminating information as to their identities in violation of their right to remain silent and the privilege against self-incrimination. They contended that this destroyed the very essence of the right to a fair trial. The court said in para 53 that it was unable to accept this argument. It did not follow from previous cases that any direct compulsion will automatically result in a violation:\u2018While the right to a fair trial under article 6 is an unqualified right, what constitutes a fair trial cannot be the subject of a single unvarying rule but must depend on the circumstances of the particular case.\u2019In para 57, the court said that those who choose to keep and drive motor cars can be taken to have accepted certain responsibilities as part of the regulatory framework relating to motor vehicles. In para 58 the court brought into account the limited nature of the inquiry which the police were authorised to undertake, that the relevant statute did not sanction prolonged questioning about facts giving rise to criminal offences and that, as Lord Bingham noted in Brown v Stott [2003] 1 AC 681, 705, the penalty for declining to answer was moderate and non-custodial.32. In N v United Kingdom (2008) 47 EHRR 885 the applicant was seriously ill on her arrival in the United Kingdom on a false passport from Uganda and was diagnosed as being HIV positive. She improved after prolonged medical treatment in this country. When steps were taken for her removal to Uganda she claimed that this would violate her rights under article 3 as the medication that she needed would only be available at considerable expense and would not be easily accessible. In para 44 the court repeated the observation that it had made in Soering that inherent in the whole Convention is a search for a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights. Advances in medical science, together with social and economic differences between countries, meant that the levels of treatment available there might vary considerably:\u2018While it is necessary, given the fundamental importance of article 3 in the Convention system, for the court to retain a degree of flexibility to prevent expulsion in very exceptional cases, article 3 does not place an obligation on the contracting state to alleviate such disparities through the provision of free and unlimited health care to all aliens without a right to stay within its jurisdiction. A finding to the contrary would place too great a burden on the contracting states.\u201933. In Saadi v United Kingdom, application no 13229/03, 29 January 2008, the Grand Chamber examined the notion of arbitrary detention in the context of the first limb of article 5(1)(f) which authorises the detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry to the country: paras 67 to 74. Its observations were directed to the restrictions permitted by the various sub-paragraphs of article 5(1). In para 67 the Grand Chamber said that it is a fundamental principle that no detention that is arbitrary can be compatible with article 5(1) and that the notion of \u2018arbitrariness\u2019 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law. In para 68 it said that the notion of arbitrariness in the context of this article varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved. In para 74 it said that, to avoid being branded as arbitrary, such detention must be carried out in good faith and its length should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued. The ambit of article 5(1) was not the point at issue in that case. But it must follow from these observations that measures of crowd control which involve a restriction on liberty, if they are not to be held to be arbitrary, must be carried out in good faith and should not exceed the length that is reasonably required for the purpose for which the measure was undertaken.34. I would hold therefore that there is room, even in the case of fundamental rights as to whose application no restriction or limitation is permitted by the Convention, for a pragmatic approach to be taken which takes full account of all the circumstances. No reference is made in article 5 to the interests of public safety or the protection of public order as one of the cases in which a person may be deprived of his liberty. This is in sharp contrast to article 10(2), which expressly qualifies the right to freedom of expression in these respects. But the importance that must be attached in the context of article 5 to measures taken in the interests of public safety is indicated by article 2 of the Convention, as the lives of persons affected by mob violence may be at risk if measures of crowd control cannot be adopted by the police. This is a situation where a search for a fair balance is necessary if these competing fundamental rights are to be reconciled with each other. The ambit that is given to article 5 as to measures of crowd control must, of course, take account of the rights of the individual as well as the interests of the community. So any steps that are taken must be resorted to in good faith and must be proportionate to the situation which has made the measures necessary. This is essential to preserve the fundamental principle that anything that is done which affects a person\u2019s right to liberty must not be arbitrary. If these requirements are met however it will be proper to conclude that measures of crowd control that are undertaken in the interests of the community will not infringe the article 5 rights of individual members of the crowd whose freedom of movement is restricted by them.\u201dLord Scott of Foscote agreed:\u201c... in particular, that, when deciding whether a confinement or a restriction of movement imposed on an individual by some public authority constitutes a deprivement of liberty for the purposes of article 5.1 of the European Convention, the purpose of the confinement or restriction and the intentions of the persons responsible for imposing it rank very high in the circumstances to be taken into account in reaching the decision. The imposition by the police of the Oxford Circus cordon on the appellant, and many others, was done for the purposes of protecting the physical safety of the demonstrators, including the appellant, and of protecting the neighbourhood properties from the violence that it was justifiably feared some of the demonstrators would perpetrate, violence that the appellant herself regarded as likely to happen. The intention of the police was to maintain the cordon only so long as was reasonably thought necessary to achieve those purposes and it is accepted by the appellant that the cordon was not maintained longer than was necessary to achieve those purposes. In the circumstances the confinement and restriction of movement that the cordon inevitably imposed on those within it did not, in my opinion, constitute an Article 5 deprivation of their liberty. I, too, would dismiss this appeal\u201d.Lord Walker of Gestinghope also agreed with Lord Hope, but emphasised the need for caution:\u201c43. In paras 26ff of his opinion Lord Hope poses the question \u2018Is purpose relevant?\u2019 His conclusion is a very guarded one, that is (para 34) that there is room, even in the case of fundamental rights, for a pragmatic approach which takes full account of all the circumstances. I respectfully agree that it is right to be cautious on this point. The Strasbourg Court has frequently made clear that all the surrounding circumstances may be relevant in determining whether there is a deprivation of liberty: see for instance HM v Switzerland (2004) 38 EHRR 314, para 42:\u2018In order to determine whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting-point must be the specific situation of the individual concerned and account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question.\u2019It is noteworthy that the listed factors, wide as they are, do not include purpose.44. The purpose of confinement which may arguably amount to deprivation of liberty is in general relevant, not to whether the threshold is crossed, but to whether that confinement can be justified under article 5(1)(a) to (f): see for instance (in relation to article 5(1)(e)) Nielsen v Denmark (1988) 11 EHRR 175; Litwa v Poland (2001) 33 EHRR 1267; Wall v Sweden, (10 December 2002) admissibility decision 41403/98; HM v Switzerland (above); HL v United Kingdom (2005) 40 EHRR 32; Enhorn v Sweden (2005) 41 EHRR 633; and Storck v Germany (2006) 43 EHRR 96. If confinement amounting to deprivation of liberty and personal security is established, good intentions cannot make up for any deficiencies in justification of the confinement under one of the exceptions listed in article 5(1)(a) to (f), which are to be strictly construed.45. Many of these article 5(1)(e) cases also raise issues as to express or implied consent (to admission to a psychiatric ward or old people\u2019s home). Some of the earlier cases seem questionable today insofar as they relied on \u2018parental rights\u2019 (especially Nielsen, which was a nine-seven decision that the admission to a psychiatric ward of a twelve-year old boy was not a deprivation of liberty, because of his mother\u2019s \u2018parental rights\u2019). Storck has, I think, sent out a clear message indicating a different approach to the personal autonomy of young people (although the unfortunate claimant in that case was 18 years of age at the time of her compulsory medication in a locked ward in the clinic at Bremen, for which she was made an exceptionally large award for non-pecuniary loss).46. I also feel some unease about the decision in X v Germany (19 March 1981) admissibility decision 8819/79; police stations can be intimidating places for anyone, particularly children, and it seems rather disingenuous to reason that\u2018in the present case the police action was not aimed at depriving the children of their liberty but simply to obtain information from them about how they obtained possession of the objects found on them and about thefts which had occurred in the school previously.\u201947. Having said all that, however, I conclude that it is essential, in the present case, to pose the simple question: what were the police doing at Oxford Circus on 1 May 2001? What were they about? The answer is, as Lord Hope has explained in his full summary of the judge\u2019s unchallenged findings, that they were engaged in an unusually difficult exercise in crowd control, in order to avoid personal injuries and damage to property. The senior officers conducting the operations were determined to avoid a fatality such as occurred in Red Lion Square on 15 June 1974. The aim of the police was to disperse the crowd, and the fact that the achievement of that aim took much longer than they expected was due to circumstances beyond their control.\u201dLord Hope stated at the end of his opinion (\u00a7 38) that he endorsed Lord Walker\u2019s remarks.Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury observed as follows:\u201c51. ... where, as happened to the appellant in this case, a person is confined in an area against her will by the police for well over six hours, in circumstances where paras (b) and (c) do not apply, the notion that there has been no infringement of article 5 seems, at least on the face of it, surprising. All the more so, given that the appellant was required to remain, in circumstances of some discomfort, in an area of some 2,000 square metres, cordoned in together with apparently some 3,000 other people, and where the confinement was in the context of the appellant exercising her undoubted right to demonstrate.52. Having said that, it is important to bear in mind that in McKay [v. the United Kingdom] (2007) 44 EHRR 41, para 30 ... the court said that the \u2018key purpose\u2019 of article 5 \u2018is to prevent arbitrary or unjustified deprivations of liberty\u2019. Apart from importantly describing the purpose of article 5, this suggests that it is necessary to examine the circumstances of a particular case in order to see if it is within the ambit of article 5, particularly when it is not a paradigm case (which is \u2018being in prison, in the custody of a gaoler\u2019 - per Lord Hoffmann in JJ [2008] 1 AC 385, para 36). This view is supported by much Strasbourg jurisprudence, and, in this connection, I would refer to two relatively recent decisions of the [Court].53. In HM v Switzerland (2004) 38 EHRR 17, para 42, the court explained that, in deciding \u2018whether there has been a deprivation of liberty, the starting-point must be the specific situation of the individual concerned\u2019. The court then said that \u2018account must be taken of a whole range of factors such as the type, duration, effects and manner of implementation of the measure in question\u2019 and that the \u2018distinction between a deprivation of and restriction upon liberty is merely one of degree or intensity, and not one of nature or substance\u2019. In Saadi v United Kingdom (Application no 13229/03), 29 January 2008, the Grand Chamber said at para 68 that \u2018key principle\u2019\u201d relating to article 5 \u2018have been developed on a case-by-case basis\u2019, and that \u2018the notion of arbitrariness in the context of article 5 varies to a certain extent depending on the type of detention involved\u2019.54. Saadi (Application no 13229/03) is also important in the present context, because it seems to make it clear that, contrary to the appellant\u2019s contention, the state of mind of the person responsible for the alleged detention can be a relevant factor in deciding whether article 5 has been infringed. In para 69, the court said that detention, even if complying with the national law, could be contrary to article 5 if \u2018there has been an element of bad faith or deception on the part of the authorities\u2019. Given the fact-sensitive nature of the enquiry and the significance of arbitrariness, this appears to me to be entirely consistent with the more general approach of the court to article 5 cases.55. However, these considerations should not be relied on to dilute the importance or the effectiveness of article 5. They simply serve to emphasise that, like all the rights enshrined in the Convention, those contained in article 5 must be approached in the way described by the [Court] in relation to article 3, another of the \u2018first rank of fundamental rights\u2019, in Soering v United Kingdom (1989) 11 EHRR 439, para 89:\u2018What amounts to \u2018inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment\u2019 depends on all the circumstances of the case. Furthermore, inherent in the whole of the Convention is a search for a fair balance between the demands of the general interest of the community and the requirements of the protection of the individual\u2019s fundamental rights.\u201956. Accordingly, particularly as the instant facts do not amount to a \u2018paradigm case\u2019, the issue of whether they fell within article 5, so that the appellant was \u2018deprived of [her] liberty, raises what is very much a fact-sensitive question. ...58. The police are under a duty to keep the peace when a riot is threatened, and to take reasonable steps to prevent serious public disorder, especially if it involves violence to individuals and property. Any sensible person living in a modern democracy would reasonably expect to be confined, or at least accept that it was proper that she could be confined, within a limited space by the police, in some circumstances. Thus, if a deranged or drunk person was on the loose with a gun in a building, the police would be entitled, indeed expected, to ensure that, possibly for many hours, members of the public were confined to where they were, even if it was in a pretty small room with a number of other people. Equally, where there are groups of supporters of opposing teams at a football match, the police routinely, and obviously properly, ensure that, in order to avoid violence and mayhem, the two groups are kept apart; this often involves confining one or both of the groups within a relatively small space for a not insignificant period. Or if there is an accident on a motorway, it is common, and again proper, for the police to require drivers and passengers to remain in their stationary motor vehicles, often for more than an hour or two. In all such cases, the police would be confining individuals for their own protection and to prevent violence to people or property.59. So, too, as I see it, where there is a demonstration, particularly one attended by a justified expectation of substantial disorder and violence, the police must be expected, indeed sometimes required, to take steps to ensure that such disorder and violence do not occur, or, at least, are confined to a minimum. Such steps must often involve restraining the movement of the demonstrators, and sometimes of those members of the public unintentionally caught up in the demonstration. In some instances, that must involve people being confined to a relatively small space for some time.60. In such cases, it seems to me unrealistic to contend that article 5 can come into play at all, provided, and it is a very important proviso, that the actions of the police are proportionate and reasonable, and any confinement is restricted to a reasonable minimum, as to discomfort and as to time, as is necessary for the relevant purpose, namely the prevention of serious public disorder and violence.61. It was suggested on behalf of the appellant that, at any rate in some of the examples I have given, consent to being confined could be imputed to the people concerned. I am not sure that that is a satisfactory analysis, not least because, unless the consent is to be treated as being involuntary or irrebuttably deemed to be given, it would not deal with the case of a person who informed the police that he objected to being confined. However, if imputed consent is an appropriate basis for justifying confinement for article 5 purposes, then it seems to me that the confinement in the present case could be justified on the basis that anyone on the streets, particularly on a demonstration with a well-known risk of serious violence, must be taken to be consenting to the possibility of being confined by the police, if it is a reasonable and proportionate way of preventing serious public disorder and violence.62. So, in agreement with the Court of Appeal, I would hold that, in the light of the findings of the Judge, as summarised in para [57] above, the actions of the police in the present case did not give rise to any infringement of the appellant\u2019s article 5 rights. The feature of the present case which gives particular cause for concern is the length of the period of confinement, nearly seven hours. However, having reached the conclusion that reasonable and proportionate constraint, which is requisite to prevent serious public disorder and violence, does not infringe article 5, it seems to me hard to contend that the mere fact that the period of constraint was unusually long can, of itself, convert a situation which would otherwise not be within the ambit of article 5 into one which is. I think that some support for that view can be found in cases where it has been held that detention in prison is not taken out of article 5 because it was only for a short time - see e.g. Novotka v Slovakia (Application No 47244/99) 4 November 2003.63. As already indicated, it appears to me that the intention of the police is relevant, particularly in a non-paradigm case, such as this, and where the intention is manifest from the external circumstances. If it transpired, for instance, that the police had maintained the cordon, beyond the time necessary for crowd control, in order to punish, or \u2018to teach a lesson\u2019 to, the demonstrators within the cordon, then it seems to me that very different considerations would arise. In such circumstances, I would have thought that there would have been a powerful argument for saying that the maintenance of the cordon did amount to a detention within the meaning of article 5. However, as is apparent from the clear and careful findings made by the Judge, which have quite rightly not been challenged on appeal, there could be no question of such a contention being raised in the present case. ...\u201dSince the House of Lords unanimously decided that Ms Austin had not been deprived of her liberty and that Article 5 did not therefore apply, it was unnecessary for them to determine whether the police action was permissible under any of the subparagraphs of Article 5 \u00a7 1. However, both Lord Hope and Lord Neuberger commented that, if there had been a deprivation of liberty, it would not have been possible for the police to justify it under the exceptions in Article 5 \u00a7 1(b) or (c).4. The other potential litigantsFollowing the events on 1 May 2001 approximately 150 people who had been confined in Oxford Circus, including the second, third and fourth applicants, contacted various firms of solicitors with the intention of commencing proceedings. The various potential applicants, their legal representatives and the representatives of the Metropolitan Police entered into correspondence with a view to progressing the claims in an efficient manner. It was agreed that the first applicant and Mr Geoffrey Saxby, who was a passer-by caught up in the cordon, would act as \u201ctest\u201d claimants (Mr Saxby subsequently withdrew from the proceedings). The Metropolitan Police provided undertakings to the legal representatives of the other claimants (including the second, third and fourth applicants) that they would not raise any limitation argument if they brought claims in the domestic courts after the test case had been determined. Following the House of Lords judgment in Ms Austin\u2019s case, the other applicants decided, on legal advice, not to bring domestic proceedings since such proceedings would inevitably have failed.COMPLAINTThe applicants complain that they were deprived of their liberty without justification under Article 5 \u00a7 1(b) or (c) of the Convention..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicants are Austrian nationals who were born in 1967, 1995 and 1967 respectively. They are represented before the Court by Mr H. Graupner, a lawyer practising in Vienna.A. The circumstances of the caseThe facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.The first applicant and the third applicant are two women living in a stable relationship. The second applicant is the third applicant\u2019s son. He was born out of wedlock and his mother has sole custody of him. The applicants live in a common household and the first and third applicants jointly care for the second applicant.By agreement concluded on 17 February 2005, the first applicant adopted the third applicant\u2019s son. The applicants\u2019 intention was to create a legal relationship between the first and the second applicant corresponding to the bond between them, without severing the relationship with his mother, the third applicant. As required by law, the applicants submitted the adoption agreement to the competent District Court for approval.The applicants, being aware that the wording of Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code (Allgemeines B\u00fcrgerliches Gesetzbuch) could be understood to exclude the adoption of the child of one partner of a homosexual couple by the other partner without severing the relationship with the natural parent, requested the Constitutional Court to declare that provision unconstitutional as discriminating against them on account of their sexual orientation.They argued in particular that in respect of heterosexual couples Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code allowed for stepchild adoption, i.e. the adoption by one partner of the other partner\u2019s child, while the latter\u2019s legal relationship with the child remained unaffected.On 14 June 2005 the Constitutional Court rejected the request as being inadmissible. It noted that the District Court was called upon to examine the question whether or not Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code allowed stepchild adoption in case of a homosexual couple. Should the District Court refuse to approve the adoption agreement the applicants remained free to submit their arguments regarding the alleged unconstitutionality of that provision to the appellate courts which in turn could bring the issue before the Constitutional Court if they shared the applicants\u2019 view.Subsequently, the applicants requested the District Court to approve the adoption agreement with the effect that both the first and the third applicant would be the second applicant\u2019s parents. The first applicant would thus replace the second applicant\u2019s father. They noted that the second applicant\u2019s father, who did not live in a common household with him, refused to agree with the adoption. However his consent would have to be replaced by the court\u2019s consent as he had failed to give valid reasons and the adoption was in the best interests of the second applicant. In support of their submissions, the applicants attached a report from the Youth Welfare Office, which confirmed that the first and third applicants shared both the daily tasks concerning the care of the second applicant and the overall responsibility for his up-bringing and concluded that the award of joint custody would be desirable.On 10 October 2005 the District Court refused to approve the adoption agreement, holding that Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code did not provide for an adoption with the effect desired by the applicants.It noted that the second applicant had been born out of wedlock and that his mother, the third applicant, had sole custody of him. The clear wording of Article 182 \u00a7 2, second sentence, of the Civil Code which had been in force since 1960, envisaged that in case of an adoption by one person that person replaced the natural parent of the same sex, thus severing the child\u2019s relationship with that person. In the case at hand the second applicant\u2019s adoption by the first applicant would sever his relationship with his mother but not with his father, as the applicants had requested. Referring to Frett\u00e9 v. France, (no. 36515/97, ECHR 2002-I), the District Court found that States retained a broad margin of appreciation when regulating adoption by homosexuals. There was thus no indication that the law as it stood, which excluded that two persons of the same sex were a child\u2019s parents, was unconstitutional.The applicants appealed. Referring to Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention they argued that Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code was discriminatory in that it led to an unjustified distinction between heterosexual and homosexual couples. So-called stepchild adoption was possible for heterosexual (married or unmarried) couples but not for homosexual couples. The present case had to be distinguished from Frett\u00e9 which had dealt with adoption by a single person living in a homosexual relationship. In contrast the present case concerned a difference in treatment between heterosexual and homosexual couples. There was research to show that children developed equally well in families with homosexual parents than in families with heterosexual parents. What was important was not the parents\u2019 sexual orientation but their ability to provide a stable and caring family.The Regional Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on 21 February 2006. In addition to the considerations of the District Court, it observed that Austrian law, though not containing a definition of the term \u201cparents\u201d, plainly envisaged two persons of different sex. Where, as in the present case, a child had both parents there was no need to replace one of them by an adoptive parent. In that connection, the Regional Court noted that the second applicant had regular contacts with his father. In general terms, for instance where heterosexual couples not living in a common household were concerned, it was in the interest of the child to have contacts with both of them. This consideration also militated against granting the adoption requested by the applicants with the effect of severing the second applicant\u2019s relationship with this natural father.Thus the difference in treatment which resulted from Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code was not an unjustified one as in case of a stepchild adoption of one partner\u2019s child by his or her heterosexual partner, the child still had two parents of different sex, while a stepchild adoption of one partner\u2019s child by the homosexual partner would deprive that child of contacts with the parent of the other sex. In short the legislator pursued the legitimate aim of maintaining a child\u2019s relationship with parents of both sexes. While the first and third applicants\u2019 choice of living in a homosexual relationship had to be respected, it did not provide a justification for obliging the second applicant to renounce any family law relationship with his natural father.On 27 September 2006 the Supreme Court dismissed the applicants\u2019 appeal on point of law.The Supreme Court observed that the primary aim of the provisions on adoption was to secure the well-being of the child. Adoption provided in the first place an opportunity to entrust suitable persons with the education and custody of orphans or of children whose parents were unable to take care of them. The aim was to put them in a situation coming as close as possible to the natural family.Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code did not disclose any appearance of being unconstitutional. In that connection the Supreme Court referred to Frett\u00e9 v. France (cited above) in which the European Court of Human Rights had accepted that States enjoyed a wide margin of appreciation in this area having regard to the great variety of opinions regarding adoption by homosexuals.The judgment was served on the applicants\u2019 counsel on 24 October 2006.B. Relevant domestic law and practiceArticle 182 \u00a7 2 second sentence of the Civil Code reads as follows:\u201c1. The same rights that arise as a consequence of legitimate descent shall be created at that time between the adoptive parent and his or her offspring, on the one hand, and the adopted child and his or her offspring who are minors at the time the adoption takes effect, on the other hand.2. If the child is adopted by a married couple, the legal relationship under family law - above and beyond the blood relationship itself - between the biological parents and their relatives, on the one hand, and the adopted child and his or her offspring who are minors at the time the adoption takes effect, on the other hand, shall cease at that time... If the child is adopted by just an adoptive father (an adoptive mother), the relationship shall cease only in respect of the biological father (the biological mother) and his (her) relatives; ...\u201dAs the Supreme Court\u2019s judgment in the present case demonstrates, this provision is interpreted as excluding the adoption of one homosexual partner\u2019s child by the other partner, without severing the relationship between the natural parent and the child.COMPLAINTThe applicants complain under Article 14 of the Convention taken in conjunction with Article 8 that they are being discriminated against on account of their sexual orientation. They submit that there is no reasonable and objective justification for allowing adoption of one partner\u2019s child by the other partner as far as heterosexual couples are concerned, while prohibiting the adoption of one partner\u2019s child by the other partner in case of homosexual couples..\n         Ensure when giving your reason you think through it step by step similarly to the example reasoning provided"}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 550, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 1, "seed": 42}}

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants. No authority form was submitted in respect of the second applicant.COMPLAINTSThe applicants complain under Articles 2 and 13 of the Convention that their relative deceased in the circumstances disclosing an unlawful and excessive use of lethal force. They also contend that no effective investigation was carried out.Lastly, the applicants allege that the circumstances of the case disclose violations of Articles 10 and 11 of the Convention.; key_case reasoning: {'Development of Case Law': 'The ECtHR noted that it had not previously been called upon to consider whether and to what extent the imposition of a statutory waiting period for granting family reunification to persons who benefit from subsidiary or temporary protection is compatible with Article 8. The ECtHR was thus afforded an opportunity to develop its case law in this respect, concluding that a wide margin of appreciation is afforded, but discretion is not unlimited.', 'Politically Sensitive': \"\\uf0a7\\tThe judgment was delivered in the context of states expressing concern regarding the increasing number of asylum-seekers displaced from Syria.

On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicants, Mr Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov, and Mr Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals who were born in 1949 and 1974 respectively and live in Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic.

He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national.

On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court.

The first applicant is represented before the Court by Ms K. Kostromina, a lawyer practising in Moscow.The facts of the case, as submitted by the applicants, may be summarised as follows.A. Death of the applicants\u2019 relativeThe applicants are the farther and the brother to Mr M. The latter person participated on 25 April 2006 in a public gathering against corruption of the local administration in the village of Miskindzhi, in the Dokuzparinskiy District of the Dagestan Republic. Several hundreds of people took part in the public gathering. Around 3 pm special squad officers encircled the participants, made several warning shots in the air and used gas bottles against the participants.This gathering was dispersed by the authorities with use of firearms (see below). M. was wounded by a grenade and deceased. Five other people were seriously wounded; a large number of people sustained injuries and were arrested.The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings on charges of murder and handling firearms (Articles 105 and 222 of the Criminal Code).A forensic expert examined the deceased\u2019s body.On 6 July 2006 the first applicant was informed that M. had been wounded with a grenade.On 31 July 2006 an investigator issued a decision discontinuing the criminal proceedings against unspecified public officials due to the absence of a criminal event.On 6 September 2006 the Federal office of forensic examination was asked to prepare a ballistic expert examination in order to determine the type of the firearms, which had been used against M. However, the experts did not reach any definite result.On 12 October 2006 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala considered that the decision of 31 July 2006 was unlawful. This court decision was subsequently quashed on appeal.On 15 November 2006 another ballistic report was sought from the Forensic Science Institute of the Federal Security Service. Its outcome is unclear. It also appears that a third report was sought from another specialised public institution.It appears that the proceedings were suspended since 26 February 2007.On 9 March 2007 the District Court upheld the discontinuation decision of 31 July 2006. On 7 May 2007 the Supreme Court of Dagestan upheld the judgment.On 30 August 2007 the applicants\u2019 lawyer brought court proceedings challenging inaction of the investigating authority. By a judgment of 8 October 2007 the Sovetskiy District Court of Makhachkala dismissed the complaint. On 14 January 2008 the Supreme Court of the Dagestan Republic upheld the judgment.The second applicant sought judicial review of the suspension decision of 26 February 2007. By a judgment of 25 July 2008 the District Court dismissed the complaint.B. Investigation concerning the dispersal of the public gatheringIn separate proceedings the second applicant complained to the Regional prosecutor\u2019s office about the dispersal of the public gathering.On 17 July 2006 a prosecutor refused to institute criminal proceedings in relation to the alleged unlawful dispersal of the public gathering.On 5 October 2006 the supervising prosecutor annulled this decision considering that the inquiry had not been thorough.On 14 December 2006 the district prosecutor issued a refusal to bring criminal proceedings.C. Proceedings before the CourtOn 11 June 2008 the first applicant issued an authority form by which he authorised Ms K. Kostromina to lodge an application before the Court. On 11 July 2008 lawyers O. Mikhaylova and K. Kostromina lodged an application before the Court on behalf of the applicants.

The politically sensitive nature of the case is reflected in the number of third-party observations made.\"};\n                                        Level 1 text: The applicant is a Syrian national, who entered Denmark in January 2015 and requested asylum. On 8 June 2015, he was granted temporary protection status for one year, under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, concerning \u201cindividuals who face capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence against civilians in their home country.\u201d His residence permit was subsequently prolonged for one year at a time.The authorities did not find that the applicant fulfilled the requirements for being granted protection under section 7, subsection 1 of the Act (individuals falling under the protection of the UN Refugee Convention) or under subsection 2 (individuals, who do not qualify as refugees, but who are facing capital punishment, torture or inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment, if returned to their home country). Residence permits under subsection 1 and 2 are normally granted for five years.On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunion with his wife, whom he married in 1990. His request was refused by a final decision of 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board (Udl\u00e6ndingen\u00e6vnet) because the applicant had not possessed a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the last three years (section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Act) and because there were no special reasons, including concern for the unity of the family, to justify family reunion under section 9, subsection 1, 1 (c) of the Act.The applicant instituted proceedings before the courts complaining that the refusal to grant him family reunion with his wife was in breach of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 8, and of Article 8 taken alone. He submitted that he had been discriminated against compared to persons granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, of the Aliens Act, because the Danish Parliament, by Act 102 of 3 February 2016, had amended section 9, subsection 1, 1 (d) of the Aliens Act, so that the right to family reunification for a person granted temporary protection status under section 7, subsection 3, in principle, was postponed from one to three years (unless special reasons existed).The High Court of Eastern Denmark (\u00d8stre Landsret) found against him in a judgment of 19 May 2017, upheld on appeal by the Supreme Court (H\u00f8jesteret) on 6 November 2017.; Level 1 reasoning: {'Development/Clarification of Case Law': \"\u2022\\tThe ECtHR clarified is approach and the applicable principles to be applied in instances in which no 'properly made claim' for compensation has been made\"};\n                                        Level 2 text: The applicant is a Bosnian national. He entered Denmark when he was 6 years old. By a judgment which became final on 12 October 2020, the applicant was convicted of drug offences. He was sentenced to 2 years\u2019 imprisonment and expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.The applicant complained that the order expelling him from Denmark was in violation of Article 8 of the Convention.; Level 2 reasoning: {'Reaffirmation of Existing Case Law': '\\uf0a7\\tThe ECtHR maintained the conclusions reached in its existing case law concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedied/access to an effective remedy with respect to constitutional redress in the context of conditions of detention.', 'Development of Case Law': \"\\uf0a7\\tBy applying existing principles to the specific facts of the applicant's case, to an extent the ECtHR developed the understanding as to what constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment further, specifically with respect to vulnerable who are minors and/or suffering from ill-health.\", 'General Measures': \"\\uf0a7\\tIn light of the violations found, the ECtHR issued general measures and, notably, stated that it anticipates that the case may give rise to a number of other well-founded applications. For this reason, whilst the case does not significantly contribute to the development of the ECtHR's case law, it nevertheless raises a particular point of interest.\"};\n                                        Level 3 text: The application concerns an Ivorian national, who reached Malta by boat in November 2021. On his arrival he claimed to be a minor born on 4 September 2004 and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was \u201cdetained\u201d for most of the time since then. In particular, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022. Between 7 and 20 December 2021, the applicant, and others who arrived with him, went through different medical check-ups, including a Covid-19 test and a chest X-ray. They resulted negative and were vaccinated during the same period. On 10 December 2020, the applicant was given a document written in French entitled \"Restriction de mouvement pour des raisons de sant\u00e9 publique\" which he did not understand. It stated that the applicant was at risk of contracting an infectious disease and therefore needed to be tested. It made reference to Article 13 (1) of the Prevention of Disease Ordinance, Chapter 36 of the Laws of Malta, which allows the Superintendent of Public Health to restrict the movement of a person who may spread disease. The applicant was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. On 17 December 2021, the applicant was admitted to the Infectious Diseases Unit of Mater Dei Hospital for treatment. He was discharged on 22 December 2022 and sent back to China House with a prescription for treatment.On an unspecified date in January 2022 the applicant was moved to Safi detention centre B Block (which mainly hosts adult men) and two days later his treatment was stopped with no explanation.On 31 January 2022 he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre, which he shared with one individual, where he remained at least until the lodging of the application with the Court. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.In the meantime, the applicant started going through age assessment procedures and by a decision of 20 January 2022, it was concluded that he was an adult. An appeal against this decision is still pending.Challenges to the lawfulness of the detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) proved futile.The applicant, reiterating that he is a minor, complains about the lawfulness and arbitrariness, as well as about the dismal conditions, of his different periods of detention and claims that he had no effective remedies in this respect.; Level 3 reasoning: {'Application of Existing Case Law': \"In its examination of the merits, the ECtHR applied criteria on expulsion and exclusion orders set out in its previous case law to the facts of the applicant's case. The judgment thus did not develop, but merely applied, its case law. The ECtHR referred to case law that was applied in its judgment in its questions to the parties (i.e., Abdi case). Reference to its earlier case law in Communicated Cases may, therefore, indicate that there are existing authorities for the ECtHR to apply, such that the judgment is likely to be categorised as importance level 3 due to 'simply apply[ing] existing case-law' only. It is notable that the ECtHR did not refer to the Uner or Maslov cases in the Communicated Case, which it cited as setting out the relevant criteria which were then applied in its judgment. In other words, the ECtHR did not cite the cases most pertinent to its judgment at the communication stage.\"}\n                                        .\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)', 'Reasoning': 'string (give your reason for the importance)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The application concerns an Ivorian national, who reached Malta by boat in November 2021.
