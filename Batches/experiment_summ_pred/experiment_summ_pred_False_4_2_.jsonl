He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

The charges were based on her participation in an International Workers' Day demonstration organized by the Confederation of Public Employees' Trade Unions (KESK) on 1 May 2006 in Elaz\u0131\u011f. On 19 January 2012, the Malatya Assize Court sentenced her to ten months' imprisonment, with the pronouncement of her conviction suspended for five years under Article 231 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, provided she did not commit another intentional offense during that period. Her objection to the conviction was dismissed on 27 March 2012. The applicant claims violations of her rights under Articles 6, 10, and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The case questions whether there has been a violation of her right to freedom of expression (Article 10) and her right to freedom of assembly (Article 11) due to her conviction under section 7 \u00a7 2 of the Prevention of Terrorism Act.

The case concerns the health and medical treatment of their son during his imprisonment and the authorities' handling of his release on health grounds. Demyan Khadzhyradov, diagnosed with HIV (clinical stage 4) and disseminated tuberculosis, was denied release despite multiple confirmations of his critical health condition by medical authorities. The prison administration delayed and questioned medical recommendations, leading to his deteriorating health and eventual death from acute heart failure. The applicants allege that the prison failed to provide adequate medical care and acted negligently in processing their son's release. They also pursued civil and criminal proceedings against the prison, which were ultimately dismissed. The applicants claim a violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, arguing that the authorities did not take reasonable measures to prevent their son's death, failed to protect his health and well-being, and did not provide prompt and adequate medical care..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade.

The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11.

He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020.

The courts suggested that the applicant should seek compensation through pending criminal proceedings against a municipal official involved in the demolition. However, these criminal proceedings were discontinued without charges before the High Administrative Court's final decision on 22 January 2014, which rejected her claim for damages.

The case concerns events following a protest against alleged electoral fraud in Chi\u015fin\u0103u on 6 and 7 April 2009. Initially peaceful, the protest turned violent on 7 April, leading to clashes with police, damage to the Parliament building and Presidential Palace, and injuries to both police officers and protesters. The police eventually abandoned the buildings, allowing protesters to enter and cause further destruction. Around 200 people were arrested that night on charges of large-scale disorder. Mr. Craciuneac, who participated in the protest, was stopped by police while returning home in a mini bus around 1 a.m. on 8 April. He was taken to a police station and subjected to severe ill-treatment, including beatings, forced nudity, and other forms of abuse. He was released on 10 April and subsequently filed a criminal complaint against the police officers. A forensic medical examination on 13 April revealed numerous bruises, and he was later hospitalized for a head concussion. The investigation into his complaint was stayed on 18 May 2010 due to the inability to identify the perpetrators, and his appeal was dismissed on 10 November 2011. Mr. Craciuneac complains under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) about the ill-treatment, inhuman and degrading detention conditions, lack of medical assistance, failure to provide food, and ineffective investigation. He also complains under Article 13 ECHR about the lack of an effective remedy for his ill-treatment. The Court has posed questions to the parties regarding whether the applicant was subjected to ill-treatment contrary to Article 3, the effectiveness of any investigation conducted, and the availability of an effective domestic remedy as required by Article 13..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

Kasl. The case stems from restitution proceedings initiated in 1992 by Mr. J. and Ms. K. to reclaim movable property confiscated during the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1942 and again by the Czechoslovak State in 1945. After Mr. J.'s death in 1998, Mr. Colloredo-Mansfeld continued the proceedings. The property in question was located in Opo\u010dno castle, which belonged to another person. The applicant's claim was initially upheld by the Pardubice District Court in 2006, but this decision was overturned by the Hradec Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Regional Court in 2007, which ruled that the property had been taken before the critical date of 25 February 1948, making the restitution laws inapplicable. The applicant's appeals were dismissed by the Supreme Court in 2009 and the Constitutional Court in 2010. A second application was similarly dismissed by the District Court in 2009, the Regional Court in 2011, the Supreme Court in 2011, and the Constitutional Court in 2012. The applicant claims violations of his right to a fair trial under Article 6 of the Convention and his right to property under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, arguing that the decision of the Ministry of Agriculture from 30 April 1947, which was used as evidence, was not disclosed to him, and that the domestic courts' decisions were inadequately reasoned..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade.

Additionally, the first applicant sought judicial authorization for the children to travel to Brazil, which was granted but delayed due to prolonged proceedings.

Nikoloski. The case concerns a civil action initiated in 2007 by Mr. Sedlovski's former wife, G.S., to claim her share of a jointly owned house in Prilep. The Prilep Court of First Instance partially allowed the claim on 14 October 2011, with the dispute value later set at MKD 1,000,000 (approximately EUR 16,200). Mr. Sedlovski appealed on 25 November 2011, citing a dispute value of MKD 204,600. The Bitola Court of Appeal dismissed his appeal, affirming the dispute value as MKD 1,000,000. Subsequently, Mr. Sedlovski lodged an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court, which was rejected on 23 January 2014 as inadmissible ratione valoris. The Supreme Court held that the increase in dispute value violated the Civil Procedure Code, thus falling short of the statutory threshold of MKD 500,000 (around EUR 8,100). The court also noted that the court fees paid by the plaintiff corresponded to a dispute value of MKD 40,000. Mr. Sedlovski complains under Articles 6 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights that the rejection of his appeal on points of law deprived him of his right of access to the Supreme Court. The key legal issue is whether the Supreme Court's refusal to consider his appeal constitutes a violation of Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, which guarantees the 'right to a court' in the determination of civil rights and obligations..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v. Denmark and Avci v.

On 5 January 2001, during military training in a mountainous area, an unidentified soldier stepped on his left arm, causing severe pain and swelling. Despite his condition, he could not see a doctor until the next evening. The initial medical examination at the regiment infirmary was inadequate, and subsequent examinations at \u0130zmir Military Hospital were inconsistent and insufficient. The splint applied to his arm was done by an untrained individual, leading to further complications. On 9 January 2001, he was diagnosed with compartment syndrome and transferred to Dokuz Eyl\u00fcl University Hospital, where his left arm was eventually amputated. No disciplinary investigation was initiated, and the \u0130zmir Military Public Prosecutor decided not to pursue further proceedings. However, criminal proceedings against the orthopaedist, C.\u00d6., resulted in a conviction for malpractice, though the sentence was suspended. The applicant's compensation request to the Supreme Military Administrative Court was partially granted for non-pecuniary damages but rejected for pecuniary damages. The applicant alleges breaches of his right to life due to inadequate medical treatment and ineffective examination of the circumstances surrounding his amputation. He also argues that the Supreme Military Administrative Court lacked independence and impartiality and that the non-communication of the principal public prosecutor's opinion violated the principle of equality of arms. The Court is asked to consider whether the domestic authorities took necessary measures to safeguard the applicant's integrity and whether the proceedings before the Supreme Military Administrative Court were fair..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

In 1997, he received a house and plot of land as a gift from his mother and lived there with his wife and children. On 25 December 2000, he gifted the house to his wife, with the condition that he and his children could continue living there. The couple divorced in 2002. In 2015, his former wife initiated eviction proceedings against him, but the Tuapse Town Court dismissed her claim, affirming his right to live in the house based on the 2000 gift deed. In 2016, his former wife sold the house to her mother, who then brought eviction proceedings against the applicant. The Town Court again dismissed the eviction claim in 2017, upholding the applicant's right to live in the house. However, the Krasnodar Regional Court quashed this decision and ordered his eviction without alternative accommodation, stating that the 2016 sale contract annulled the 2000 gift deed provisions. The applicant's subsequent cassation appeals were rejected by both the Regional Court and the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation. The applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention that the domestic courts ordered his eviction in breach of domestic law and without examining his arguments. The questions to the parties are: 1) Has there been an interference with the applicant\u2019s right to respect for his home under Article 8 \u00a7 1 of the Convention? 2) If so, was the interference lawful, pursued a legitimate aim, and necessary under Article 8 \u00a7 2 of the Convention?

He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life.

The Pula Municipal Court dismissed his action on 20 February 2008. Mr. Samard\u017ei\u0107 appealed to the Pula County Court, which dismissed his appeal on 12 September 2011, agreeing with the outcome but noting misinterpretations of facts by the first-instance court. He then appealed to the Supreme Court on 5 December 2011, which declared his appeal inadmissible on 14 May 2013, stating that the second-instance court's dismissal was based on different grounds and that section 373a of the Civil Procedure Act was not applicable. Subsequently, Mr. Samard\u017ei\u0107 lodged a constitutional complaint, which was declared inadmissible by the Constitutional Court on 16 October 2013.

He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11.

He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020.

The applicants allege that they were subjected to collective expulsion without individual assessment or access to the asylum procedure. They claim that the police interviews were either not conducted properly or not conducted at all, and that they were misled into signing documents they did not understand. The applicants were issued administrative expulsion decisions on the same day, which included a three-year ban on re-entering Slovakia and were expelled to Ukraine that night. They argue that they were not given copies of the expulsion decisions while still in Slovakia and only obtained them later through their legal representative. After their expulsion, the applicants were detained in Ukraine and faced difficulties in contacting legal assistance. The applicants complain under Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) that their expulsion was collective and under Article 13 in conjunction with Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 that they had no effective remedy to challenge their expulsion.

He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022.

Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

On 25 December 2002, he was arrested on suspicion of assaulting Mr. Ko. and subsequently confessed to this crime without legal assistance, claiming he was beaten by police officers. He also confessed to the robbery and murder of Mr. Kol. on 26 December 2002, again without a lawyer present. He alleges further beatings and threats by police officers on 27-28 December 2002. Despite his claims of duress and requests for medical examination, the domestic authorities refused to institute criminal proceedings against the officers. Mr. Belugin was convicted of murder and robbery on 9 June 2006 and sentenced to twenty years in prison. He contends that his arrest record was not compiled within the required three hours, he was denied legal assistance, and his conviction was based on unlawfully obtained evidence, including coerced confessions. The case raises questions about the date of introduction for the six-month time limit, potential hindrance of the right of application, inhuman or degrading treatment, procedural rights violations, and the fairness of the trial under Articles 3, 5, 6, and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification.

The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11.

The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

The Harju County Court authorized the attachment of the cash found in a safety deposit box used by A.K.'s partner, L.K., and later confiscated it after A.K.'s conviction for a drug offense. The court determined that the money in the deposit box was linked to A.K.'s illegal activities and that L.K. could be subject to the confiscation decision as a third party under Article 832 \u00a7 2 of the Penal Code. The applicant, L.K.'s mother, asserts that she rented the safety deposit box and owned the cash. She was not included in the criminal proceedings and only learned of the confiscation after A.K.'s conviction was finalized. Her appeals to challenge the attachment decision and to reopen the criminal proceedings were dismissed on the grounds that she was not an addressee of the decision. The Harju County Court suggested that she could still lodge a claim against the State to assert her ownership of the money, but it appears she has not done so. The case raises questions about whether the applicant had effective access to court under Article 6 \u00a7 1 of the Convention, specifically whether she had an adequate opportunity to present her case and prove her ownership of the cash, and whether she had a practical and legal possibility to submit a claim against the State. The Government is asked to provide information on relevant domestic case-law, including any developments after the Supreme Court's judgment in case no. 3-1-2-3-12, and to submit the Tallinn Court of Appeal's decision no. 1-15-7663, which dismissed L.K.'s appeal on the attachment decision..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017.

Following a meeting between the Chinese ambassador to Chi\u015fin\u0103u and Moldovan authorities, the Government demanded the cancellation of the concerts to preserve good diplomatic relations with China. On the concert days, police blocked the entrance to the National Theatre, leading to the cancellation of the events. The applicant sued the National Theatre and the Government, alleging violations of their rights under Articles 10 and 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights and seeking compensation for damages. The Supreme Court of Justice's final judgment on 14 August 2013 awarded the applicant a small fraction of the claimed pecuniary damages without acknowledging any breach of Convention rights. The applicant contends that their rights to freedom of expression and assembly were violated by the domestic authorities' actions and that the national courts failed to address these breaches.

He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

V.S. verbally abused her with derogatory terms and punched her in the head, causing a concussion. The applicant claims the assault was motivated by religious intolerance and requested the case be investigated under Article 161 \u00a7 2 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code, which addresses crimes committed on the grounds of religious enmity. However, the police and courts classified the incident under Article 125 \u00a7 2, dealing with minor physical injuries, and did not find evidence of religious hatred. V.S. was fined 850 UAH and ordered to pay 3,000 UAH in non-pecuniary damages. The applicant's appeals, arguing that the authorities failed to investigate the religious motive, were dismissed by higher courts. The applicant now complains under Articles 3, 9, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, asserting that her allegations of religiously motivated ill-treatment were not properly investigated..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

Symphysiotomy, a surgical procedure to enlarge the pelvis, was reintroduced in certain Irish hospitals in the mid-20th century despite being largely abandoned in Western Europe due to the safer alternative of caesarean sections. L.F. claims she suffered long-term physical and psychological effects from the procedure, which she only became aware of after watching a television documentary in 2010. She pursued a civil action for damages against the hospital, which was ultimately dismissed by the Court of Appeal on the grounds that the claim was statute-barred and that the procedure was justified by the medical standards of the time. L.F. did not apply to an ex-gratia payment scheme established by the Irish government in 2014, believing it did not adequately acknowledge the breach of her rights or the gravity of the harm inflicted. She now complains under Articles 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in conjunction with Article 13, that she was precluded from making any complaint about the performance of the symphysiotomy without her informed consent and that there has never been an independent and thorough investigation into the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. The European Court of Human Rights has communicated the case to the respondent Government, raising questions about the exhaustion of domestic remedies, the effectiveness of available remedies, and whether the State has fulfilled its procedural obligations under Article 3..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

The applicant contends that the Bulgarian legal framework is deficient as it does not classify light bodily harm in the context of domestic violence as a publicly prosecutable offense, thus failing to provide effective protection under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Volni, a lawyer in Budapest. Mr. Prizzia's previous application (no. 4966/05) was declared inadmissible on 11 December 2007. The current case concerns the enforcement of Mr. Prizzia's access rights to his child, born on 3 February 2003, following his divorce. The Budapest Central District Court initially placed the child with the mother and regulated Mr. Prizzia's access rights, allowing him to spend four days each month and one month of the summer holiday with his child, including travel to the USA. However, the mother repeatedly failed to comply with these access rights, leading to multiple complaints and enforcement attempts by Mr. Prizzia. Despite fines and orders from various authorities, the mother continued to obstruct Mr. Prizzia's access, including withholding the child's passport. The applicant's efforts to change custody and enforce access rights through Hungarian courts were largely unsuccessful, and his access was eventually limited to Hungary. Mr. Prizzia complains that the authorities failed to enforce the court's decision on his access rights for five years, that the court's decision on visit days was overly burdensome, and that his visits were unfairly restricted to Hungary. He alleges violations of Articles 6 and 8 of the Convention, Article 2 \u00a7\u00a7 2 and 3 of Protocol No. 4, and Article 5 of Protocol No. 7. The key legal questions are whether there has been a violation of Mr. Prizzia's right to respect for his family life under Article 8, and whether the length of the civil proceedings breached the 'reasonable time' requirement of Article 6 \u00a7 1..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020.

In 1971, the applicant's purported biological father obtained a final court ruling stating there was insufficient evidence to conclude that the applicant was his son. The applicant, born in 1969, only became aware of this judgment in 2012 after his 'father's' death. He then sought to reopen the civil proceeding to establish paternity definitively through DNA testing, which required a court order. However, by 23 January 2014, the regular courts at two instances and the Constitutional Court ruled against the applicant, citing a lack of procedural basis for reopening the case. The legal issue at hand is whether there has been a violation of the applicant's right to respect for his private life under Article 8 of the Convention, in light of precedents such as J\u00e4ggi v.

The case involves three main issues: internet access, denial of an extended visit, and a claim for damages. Firstly, Mr. Jankovskis requested internet access to obtain information about university enrollment, but his request was denied by the prison authorities and upheld by the courts, citing security concerns and lack of legal provisions for internet use by prisoners. Secondly, after being punished for violating prison rules, Mr. Jankovskis was moved to a special order group with restricted rights, resulting in the cancellation of an approved extended visit by his parents. This decision was also upheld by the courts. Lastly, Mr. Jankovskis' personal computer was seized by the prison authorities, leading him to file a claim for damages. The courts found the seizure unlawful but deemed the overall prison conditions satisfactory, except for minor issues. Mr. Jankovskis complains under Articles 10 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) about the refusal of internet access, under Article 4 of Protocol No. 7 about the denial of extended visits, and under Articles 3 and 14 of the ECHR about the prison conditions and alleged discrimination.

His detention was ordered by the Nasimi District Court and upheld by the Baku Court of Appeal. Mr. Jafarov's requests for release on bail or house arrest were denied. He claims his arrest and detention were unlawful and aimed at silencing him as an NGO activist, in violation of Articles 5, 11, and 18 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v.

Upon arrival, he was arrested and issued a Return Decision and Removal Order due to his status as a prohibited immigrant under Maltese law. He was detained in Safi Barracks pending deportation. While detained, he applied for asylum, which was ultimately rejected. He also challenged the legality of his detention, arguing that it was contrary to law and that less coercive measures were not considered. His challenge was rejected by the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) after more than a year. Additionally, he was involved in a riot at Safi Barracks, leading to criminal charges and further detention. The applicant complains under Article 5 \u00a7 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) that his detention was not lawful or justified, under Article 5 \u00a7 2 that he was not informed of the reasons for his detention, and under Article 5 \u00a7 4 that he did not have access to a speedy and efficient remedy to challenge his detention. The Court has communicated the case to the respondent Government, raising questions about the lawfulness and arbitrariness of the applicant's detention, whether he was promptly informed of the reasons for his detention, and whether he had access to effective legal remedies..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}

They alleged that Mr. Siderov's public statements, made through various media, constituted harassment and incitement to discrimination against Roma people.

Importance in a legal setting refers to the significance of a case in terms of its impact on the development of case law.\n        The following information is provided to you:\n        You will be given a communicated case, including the case summary.\n        You are given a description of the different levels of importance: key_case: These are the most important and have been selected as key cases and have been selected for publication in the Court's official reports; \n                               1: The case is of high importance. The case makes a significant contribution to the development, clarification or modification of its case law, either generally or in relation to a particular case; \n                               2: The case is of medium importance. The case while not making a significant contribution to the case-law, nevertheless it goes beyond merely applying existing case law; \n                               3: The case is of low importance. The case is of limited interest and simply applies existing case law\n                            .\n        You are also given a number of examples for each level of importance. \n                                    key_case: The applicant, a Syrian national, entered Denmark in January 2015 and sought asylum. He was granted temporary protection status for one year on 8 June 2015 under section 7, subsection 3, of the Aliens Act, which applies to individuals facing capital punishment, torture, or inhumane or degrading treatment due to severe instability and indiscriminate violence in their home country. His residence permit was extended annually. The authorities did not find him eligible for protection under section 7, subsections 1 or 2, which would have granted a five-year residence permit. On 4 November 2015, the applicant requested family reunification with his wife, whom he married in 1990. This request was denied on 16 September 2016 by the Immigration Appeals Board because he had not held a residence permit under section 7, subsection 3, for the required three years, and there were no special reasons to justify family reunification. The applicant challenged this decision in court, arguing that it violated Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8, and Article 8 alone, of the European Convention on Human Rights. He claimed discrimination compared to individuals granted protection under section 7, subsections 1 and 2, especially after the Danish Parliament amended the law to extend the waiting period for family reunification from one to three years for those with temporary protection status. The High Court of Eastern Denmark ruled against him on 19 May 2017, a decision upheld by the Supreme Court on 6 November 2017. The case questions whether the refusal to grant family reunification breached the applicant's rights under Article 8 or Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention.; 1: The applicants, Mr. Yarmet Uzerovich Nagmetov and Mr. Rafik Yarmetovich Nagmetov, are Russian nationals from Makhachkala, Dagestan Republic. They are represented by Ms. K. Kostromina, a lawyer from Moscow. The case concerns the death of their relative, Mr. M., who was killed during a public gathering against local administration corruption in Miskindzhi on 25 April 2006. The gathering was dispersed by special squad officers using firearms and gas, resulting in Mr. M. being fatally wounded by a grenade. The Dagestan regional prosecutor initiated criminal proceedings, but the investigation was marked by discontinuations and inconclusive forensic reports. The applicants allege violations of Articles 2 and 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, claiming unlawful and excessive use of lethal force and ineffective investigation. They also allege violations of Articles 10 and 11. The Court is asked to determine the validity of the second applicant's application, whether the right to life under Article 2 was violated, and if the investigation met the procedural requirements of Article 2.; 2: The case involves an Ivorian national who arrived in Malta by boat in November 2021, claiming to be a minor born on 4 September 2004, and expressed a wish to apply for asylum. He was detained for most of the time since his arrival. Initially, he was kept in China House from 24 November 2021 until January 2022, during which he underwent various medical check-ups and was diagnosed with Pulmonary Tuberculosis on 14 December 2021. He was treated at Mater Dei Hospital and then returned to China House. In January 2022, he was moved to Safi detention centre B Block, where his treatment was stopped without explanation. Later, he was moved to a container within the Safi detention centre. A detention order was issued on 10 February 2022. The applicant underwent age assessment procedures, and it was concluded that he was an adult, a decision he is appealing. Challenges to the lawfulness of his detention before the Court of Magistrates and the Immigration Appeals Board (IAB) were unsuccessful. The applicant claims that his detention was unlawful and arbitrary, and that he had no effective remedies. The case raises several legal questions, including whether the applicant was subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment in violation of Article 3 of the Convention, whether his deprivation of liberty was in breach of Article 5 \u00a7 1, and whether he had effective procedures to challenge the lawfulness of his detention as required by Article 5 \u00a7 4 and Article 13 of the Convention.; 3: The applicant, a Bosnian national who entered Denmark at the age of 6, was convicted of drug offences and sentenced to 2 years' imprisonment by a judgment that became final on 12 October 2020. Additionally, the applicant was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. The applicant contends that this expulsion order violates Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. The key legal issue is whether the expulsion and permanent re-entry ban, given the applicant's 2-year imprisonment sentence, constitute a breach of Article 8 of the Convention, as referenced in similar cases such as Abdi v. Denmark and Avci v. Denmark..\n        Based on the information given to you, as well as any relevant case law from the European Court of Human Rights, predict the importance of the case according to the criteria given. \n        If you do not know the importance, state that you do not have enough information.\n        The output should be given directly in JSON format, with the following schema: {'Case Importance': 'string (select one of: key_case, 1, 2, 3)'}.\n        The communicated case information you should base your judgement on is as follows: The applicants, Austrian nationals born in 1967 and 1995, are represented by Mr. H. Graupner, a lawyer in Vienna. The first and third applicants are women in a stable relationship, and the second applicant is the third applicant's son, born out of wedlock and under her sole custody. The applicants live together and jointly care for the second applicant. On 17 February 2005, the first applicant adopted the third applicant's son to legally formalize their bond without severing the child's relationship with his mother. They submitted the adoption agreement to the District Court for approval. Aware that Article 182 \u00a7 2 of the Civil Code might exclude such adoptions for homosexual couples, they requested the Constitutional Court to declare the provision unconstitutional for being discriminatory based on sexual orientation. The Constitutional Court rejected the request, stating that the District Court should first examine the issue. The District Court later refused the adoption, citing that Article 182 \u00a7 2 did not allow the desired effect and that the law excluded same-sex couples from being recognized as a child's parents. The applicants appealed, arguing that the provision was discriminatory under Articles 8 and 14 of the Convention. The Regional Court dismissed the appeal, emphasizing the importance of maintaining a child's relationship with parents of both sexes. The Supreme Court also dismissed the appeal, noting that the primary aim of adoption laws was the child's well-being and that the provision did not appear unconstitutional. The applicants complain under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 of the Convention, alleging discrimination based on sexual orientation, as the law allows stepchild adoption for heterosexual couples but not for homosexual couples..\n        "}], "response_format": {"type": "json_object"}, "max_tokens": 500, "temperature": 0, "top_p": 0.5, "seed": 42}}
