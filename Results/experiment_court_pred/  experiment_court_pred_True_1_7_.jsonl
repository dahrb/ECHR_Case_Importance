Given the detailed factual background, the involvement of multiple applicants, and the extensive domestic legal proceedings, the European Court of Human Rights is likely to rule on the merits of the case. Therefore, it is more likely to result in a Judgment rather than a Decision.\"\n}"}, "logprobs": null, "finish_reason": "stop"}], "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 11027, "completion_tokens": 206, "total_tokens": 11233}, "system_fingerprint": "fp_ce0793330f"}}, "error": null}
