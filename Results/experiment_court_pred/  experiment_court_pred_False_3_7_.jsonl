The first-instance court awarded him the costs, but the County Court ultimately held that the applicant had withdrawn his action following a settlement and that hence each party was to bear its own costs. The applicant then filed an appeal on points of law with the Supreme Court and a constitutional complaint with the Constitutional Court, both of which were declared inadmissible. The applicant complains under Article 6 of the Convention and under Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention, that the failure to reimburse him incurred costs of the proceedings in the circumstances had violated his right of access to a court as well as his property rights. He further complains: a) under Article 6 of the Convention about a violation of his right to legal certainty and the divergent case-law of the County Courts in identical cases to his own: he submitted a number of court decisions to show that in identical cases some County Courts awarded the costs sought, while others ordered each party to bear its own costs; b) under Article 14 of the Convention about discrimination in relation to those persons who had identical claims to his and who had been awarded reimbursement of their costs, and c) under Article 13 of the Convention that he had no effective remedy against the divergent case-law of the county courts, given that the Supreme Court declared his appeal on points of law inadmissible.\",\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The case involves multiple substantive issues under the Convention, including the right of access to a court, property rights, legal certainty, discrimination, and the availability of effective remedies. These issues require a detailed examination of the merits of the case, which is characteristic of a judgment rather than a decision.

He is unmarried and has no children. By a final judgment of 10 August 2009, the Supreme Court found it established that the applicant had committed aggravated assault resulting in the victim\u2019s death. Due to his state of insanity, the applicant could not be held criminally liable. The Supreme Court therefore ordered him placed in a psychiatric hospital, without a fixed timeframe. Moreover, he was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. Subsequent to a request by the psychiatric hospital in 2013 that the measure should be replaced by outpatient psychiatric treatment, the applicant, by virtue of section 50 a of the Aliens Act, requested the expulsion order revoked due to his state of health. He maintained that he would not be able to obtain the required psychiatric treatment in Turkey. By decision of 14 October 2014, the City Court revoked the expulsion order. On appeal, on 13 January 2015, the High Court refused to revoke the expulsion order. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused on 20 May 2015.
