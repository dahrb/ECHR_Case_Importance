Due to his state of insanity, the applicant could not be held criminally liable. The Supreme Court therefore ordered him placed in a psychiatric hospital, without a fixed timeframe. Moreover, he was expelled from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning.

He maintained that he would not be able to obtain the required psychiatric treatment in Turkey. By decision of 14 October 2014, the City Court revoked the expulsion order. On appeal, on 13 January 2015, the High Court refused to revoke the expulsion order. Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court was refused on 20 May 2015.
