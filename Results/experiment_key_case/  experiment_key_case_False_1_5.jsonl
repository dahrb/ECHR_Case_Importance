The Supreme Court ordered him placed in a psychiatric hospital without a fixed timeframe and expelled him from Denmark with a life-long ban on returning. In 2013, the psychiatric hospital requested that the measure be replaced by outpatient psychiatric treatment. The applicant requested the expulsion order be revoked due to his state of health, arguing he would not be able to obtain the required psychiatric treatment in Turkey. The City Court revoked the expulsion order, but the High Court refused to revoke it on appeal. The applicant complained that the decision to refuse to revoke the expulsion order was in breach of Articles 3 or 8 of the Convention.\",\n  \"Reasoning\": \"The case is of medium importance because it goes beyond merely applying existing case law.
