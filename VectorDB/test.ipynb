       "[Document(metadata={'Word Count': 2525, 'The Law': '1. The applicant complains that the Hungarian authorities’ procedure concerning his request for asylum and his potential deportation amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.Article 3 of the Convention provides that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.Article 34, so far as relevant, provides that the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols thereto.The Government submit that on 25 January 1999 the Office ruled that, in pursuance of S. 32 § 1 of the 1993 Aliens Act, the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt. According to S. 25 of Government Decree no. 64/1994, the applicant should not in the future be deported from Hungarian territory as long as the relevant situation in his country of origin persists, i.e. the reasons prohibiting his expulsion cease to exist. For the duration of the asylum proceedings, he is authorised to reside in Hungary. A temporary residence permit will be issued to him, should he not be granted refugee status in the court proceedings. In these circumstances the Government are of the view that the applicant’s complaint has lost relevance.The applicant submits that the applicant’s forcible return to Egypt, as attempted by the Hungarian authorities notwithstanding that his court action was pending, could have resulted in his expulsion to Iraq and thus could have exposed him to a treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, the absence of a thorough investigation into his statements in the asylum proceedings and, in particular, the fact that the Hungarian authorities did not prevent the Iraqi consul from interfering with their proceedings amounted to another violation of Article 3. Unless he will be granted asylum in the pending court proceedings, the issue of his subsistence in Hungary is not resolved, since the certificate to be issued under S. 25 of Government Decree no. 64/1994 would not guarantee him any legal status with a view to staying in Hungary.The Court observes that on 25 January 1999 the Office decided that the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it is not called upon to examine the applicant’s complaints concerning his attempted return to Egypt or the alleged shortcomings of the asylum proceedings. Since the applicant is not exposed any more to the imminent danger of being expelled to a country where he might be subjected to a treatment in breach of Article 3, he can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under that Article within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.2. The applicant also complains under Article 13 read in conjunction with Article 3 of the Convention that there was no effective remedy at his disposal to challenge the denial of a refugee status and his attempted forcible return to Egypt since the court action to challenge the lawfulness of the administrative proceedings had no suspensive effect.Article 13 of the Convention provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.The Court notes that in the decision of 22 December 1998 it was specified that an action to challenge the lawfulness of the asylum proceedings was of no suspensive effect concerning the applicant’s return to Cairo as ordered and, moreover, that subsequently the Hungarian authorities attempted to execute his return, notwithstanding the fact that his action had meanwhile been filed with the Budapest Regional Court. The question arises, therefore, whether - when introducing his application - the applicant had at his disposal a remedy before the national authorities concerning his deportation which could be considered effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.However, as set out above in regard to his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant is no longer exposed to the threat of imminent expulsion from Hungary. In the light of this development in the case, his pending court action for asylum can now be regarded as capable of redressing his claim. Consequently, this remedy cannot be held ineffective for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is likewise manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.3. Lastly, the applicant complains that his detention at the Communal Accommodation of the Budapest Border Guards Directorate amounted to a deprivation of liberty contrary to Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 in that it was not ordered in a manner satisfactorily prescribed by law and could not be appealed to a judicial body.Article 5 §§ 1 and 4, so far as relevant, provide:“1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...f. the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition. …4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.”Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, so far as relevant, provides that the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law.The Government submit that the Communal Accommodation was lawfully designated as the applicant’s compulsory place of residence under S. 43 of the 1993 Aliens Act. Paragraph 5 of that Section provides that the judicial review of an order designating a compulsory place of residence can be requested from the courts. According to Ss. 39 to 42, such review may be requested at any time during detention. In the court proceedings the claimant must be heard in person and the court’s decisions is subject to appeal. Section 50 provides that the courts shall proceed speedily in these matters. Since, however, the applicant has not availed himself of this remedy, his complaints should be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.The applicant submits that the domestic legal provisions on the designation of a foreigner’s compulsory place of residence are not clear enough to meet the criteria of accessibility and precision. In the light of the non-suspensive effect of the request for the judicial review of the deportation order, the applicant could not have recourse to a remedy, effective for the purposes of Article 5 § 4, to challenge the lawfulness of the deprivation of his liberty. In any event, such a remedy could have been pursued only under the relevant rules of the Code of Civil Procedure: to achieve a judicial review of the impugned administrative decision, a proper action must have been brought in default of which the request might have been rejected without an examination on the merits. In a situation where legal assistance was hardly available, the relevant formal requirements rendered this remedy virtually inaccessible. Furthermore, due to the courts’ heavy workload, the proceedings in question may have lasted for months, contrary to the requirement of speediness under Article 5 § 4.The Court considers that it is not called upon to decide whether the applicant’s commitment to the Communal Accommodation amounted to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention or whether it was ordered lawfully, since these complaints are in any event inadmissible for the reasons set out below.The Court recalls that the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 19, § 36). The Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines (see the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 30-31, § 66). Where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a domestic remedy, that remedy must be tried (cf., e.g., No. 13669/88, Dec. 7.3.90, D. R. 65, p. 245).In the present case the Court observes that S. 43 § 5 of the 1993 Aliens Act provides that a judicial review of an administrative decision ordering a foreigner’s compulsory place of residence may be requested from the competent court. However, the applicant did not avail himself of this remedy. The Court finds that mere doubts as to the outcome or the length of the court proceedings in question did not exempt the applicant from having to exhaust the domestic remedy available to him.It follows that this part of the application must be rejected under Article 35 § 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Erik Fribergh Marc Fischbach Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-05-04 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4570', 'appno': '45163/99', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'HUN', 'extractedappno': '45163/99;13669/88', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '183;498;14;128;444;110;350;448', 'doc_id': 'd00be02f-afac-4867-a4c8-b7a49785e09d'}, page_content='is issued; or (c) this is necessary for the purposes of guaranteeing the execution of an expulsion, until the establishment of the conditions of expulsion; or (d) his return was ordered (see S. 25 above); or (e) his return or expulsion should take place, but he may not be returned or expelled in accordance with the prohibition under S. 32 § 1.The compulsory place of residence may also be designated at a communal accommodation, if the foreigner is not able to support himself, and no appropriate accommodation, financial means, income and inviting party or relatives obliged to'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 13259, 'The Law': 'The respondent Government have in their submissions to the Court raised a number of objections to the admissibility of the application. The Court will examine the objections under the following headings:I. The scope of the application;II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç;III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practice.I. The scope of the applicationThe respondent Government maintain that the “invitation” of the applicant Government in respect of interrogation techniques in Turkey is not the object of the complaint and thus falls outside the scope of the application. The applicant Government dispute this.The Court recalls that under Article 33 of the Convention any High Contracting Party may refer to the Court any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party. The Court observes that the applicant Government complain that the ill-treatment of Mr Koç does not appear to be an isolated incident, but rather just one example of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey, inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention and invite the Court to examine whether this is in fact the case. The Court finds that the contents of the application and the written and oral submissions are sufficiently clear and precise for a judicial examination under the Convention also on this point. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application concerns not only the specific situation of Mr Koç but also, as an additional and separate complaint, the allegation of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey.II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç.The Court recalls Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which reads as follows:“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, embodied in the above provision, applies to State applications (Article 33) in the same way as it does to “individual” applications (Article 34), when the applicant State does no more than denounce a violation or violations allegedly suffered by individuals whose place is taken by the State (cf. e.g. the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series of no. 25, p. 64, §159). Accordingly, in order to examine the complaints made on behalf of Mr Koç, the Court must in principle first examine whether the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies has been complied with.The Court agrees with the respondent Government that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. This is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. This is, inter alia, the case where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance thereof by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (ibid.).In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is furthermore a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non‑exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant - in the specific case the applicant Government - to establish that the remedy advanced was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see e.g. the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, § 68).In the present case the Court recalls that the respondent Government maintain that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with, in particular since criminal proceedings are at present pending before the Court of Cassation where the allegations made by Mr Koç will be examined and, if necessary, redressed. The applicant Government maintain, however, that this remedy is inadequate and ineffective, in particular since the allegations concern an administrative practice of ill-treatment of persons in police custody.The Court finds that the question of whether the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies applies or has been satisfied in the present case raises issues which are so closely related to the question of the existence of an administrative practice that, to avoid prejudging the latter, both issues should be examined together. It recalls, however, that at the stage of admissibility, in inter-State cases, it is not the Court’s task to carry out a preliminary examination of the merits, since the provisions of Article 35 - empowering it to declare inadmissible petitions which it considers either incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or manifestly ill-founded - apply only to individual applications under Article 34. Consequently, any examination of the merits of the application must in such cases be reserved for the post-admissibility stage.Accordingly, the Court considers that the final determination of the issue concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç should be joined to the merits and reserved for later consideration.III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practiceThe Court recalls that, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant Government complain of an alleged practice of ill-treatment. They submit that persons in police custody have been tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. They have adduced evidence to show that, during the period covered by this application, torture or ill‑treatment are not merely isolated incidents or exceptions, but so widespread and applied in such a systematic manner as to constitute an administrative practice in the meaning of the case-law of the Court. The applicant Government maintain that the rule of the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application.While generally stating that the facts are not admitted, the respondent Government have not offered any counter-evidence or made comments on the material presented by the applicant Government.The Court recalls that in principle the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply where the applicant State complains of a practice as such, with the aim of preventing its continuation or recurrence (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 64, § 159). The Court notes that in respect of this part of the application, leaving aside the particular situation of Mr Koç as set out above, the applicant Government have not asked the Court to give a decision on any individual case and it follows therefore that the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application. In addition, the Court finds from the evidence submitted that the allegation made by the applicant Government is not wholly unsubstantiated or otherwise, as set out above, lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation in the sense of Article 33 of the Convention. The further examination, however, of all other questions regarding the existence and extent of such an administrative practice and its consistency with the provisions of the Convention relate to the merits and cannot, therefore, be considered by the Court at the stage of admissibility.Finally the Court notes that the applicant Government have requested the Court to examine the period from 1 January 1996 until today.The Court considers that an issue may arise as to whether it can examine a period which goes back further than six months from the date of introduction of the application. However, as the questions relating to the six-month rule in the present circumstances are also closely linked to the questions concerning the existence and extent of the alleged administrative practice, the answers thereto would again imply a preliminary examination of the merits of the case. The Court therefore reserves these questions for later consideration.It follows that the applicant Government’s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 1 and Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, by a majority,JOINS TO THE MERITS, the questions relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç and the six-month ruleandDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.Michael O’Boyle Elisabeth Palm Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-06-08 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4644', 'appno': '34382/97', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'TUR', 'extractedappno': '34382/97;1996/74', 'conclusion': 'Admissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;193;567;197;14;128;109;471', 'doc_id': '7165ed69-e979-4a0b-a836-dad06f91b6f2'}, page_content='legal association;2. as the defendant Kemal Koç has stated that he took part in the Kurdish National Assembly in Germany in 1992 as a delegate, it should be determined whether this is true or not, the information and documents, if available, particularly from the point of view of the defendant’s participation at the meeting, should be requested from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Ministry of Justice;3. taking into consideration the nature of the crime of which the defendant Kemal Koç is accused and considering the possibility of the changes that may take place in the evidence, and provided'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 6697, 'The Law': 'The applicants complain that the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces of the United Kingdom violated their rights under Articles 3, 5, 8 and 10, alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. They also consider that they did not have an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 in respect of the alleged violations of Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14 of the Convention1. Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the ConventionThe first applicant complains about being detained by the armed forces authorities on 15 June 1994 and thereafter. The second applicant complains about being detained on 17 May 1994, during his interviews under caution on 25 and 26 May 1994 and thereafter. Both invoke Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 in these respects. Article 5 of the Convention guarantees the right to liberty and security of person and Article 14 ensures freedom from discrimination in the securement of Convention rights (see p. 18 below).However, the Court notes that applicants were definitively discharged from the air force on 16 November and 16 December 1994, respectively and that the domestic proceedings pursued by them did not relate to any detention matters. Accordingly, even assuming that the applicants could demonstrate a form of detention within the meaning of Article 5 during and/or after the investigation of their homosexuality by the armed forces authorities, and even if the six-month time-limit set down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention began to run for both applicants from the date of their discharge from the armed forces, their respective applications have been introduced (on 9 and 6 September 1996, respectively) outside of this time-limit.In such circumstances, their complaints as regards alleged periods of detention prior to their discharge from the armed forces under Articles 5 and 14 of the Convention are inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.2. Article 3 of the ConventionThe applicants complain that the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces and the consequent investigations and discharges amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. In addition, they submit that their discriminatory treatment, based on crude stereotyping and prejudice, denied and caused affront to their individuality and dignity (Nos. 4403/70 et subs, East African Asians v. the United Kingdom, Comm. Report 14.12.73, D.R. 78-A) and, as such, amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3. This Article reads, insofar as relevant, as follows:\"No one shall be subjected to ... degrading treatment or punishment.\"The Government submit that, given the serious and reasonable basis and aim of the policy (maintaining the fighting power and effectiveness of the armed forces) and in the absence of any intention to degrade or humiliate, the policy cannot be categorised as degrading. They would distinguish the above-cited East African Asians case since that case dealt with racial discrimination. They also defend the investigation procedure arguing that the aim is not to humiliate persons but to deal with cases as quickly and as discreetly as possible. The applicants chose to answer questions having been informed of their right not to so answer. Indeed the second applicant exercised for a period of time his rights not to answer and to have a lawyer present. Given the matter at issue, intimate questions are inevitable in the investigation process and the Government clarify that no reference is made in the discharge certificate to sexual orientation.In response, the applicants point out that it is sufficient if the victim is “humiliated in his own eyes” (Tyer v. United Kingdom judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 16, § 32). As to the East African Asians case, the distinction made by the Government is a technical one - they were labelled and categorised, which process debases and denigrates an individual’s existence and character. Moreover, treatment contrary to Article 3 cannot ever have a justification. As to the suggestion that the applicants could have chosen not to participate in the interviews, they submit that their complaint relates to the entire investigation and dismissal process, the caution given was in fact the standard caution given to a criminal suspect, the fact that questions were put was hurtful and degrading, and the absence of a legal obligation to answer the questions in no way mitigated that effect. In any event, the questions extended significantly beyond an inquiry into sexual orientation - the questioning continued after both applicants admitted their sexual orientation and included allegations that were offensive and unfounded.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 3 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.3. Article 8 of the ConventionThe applicants also complain under Article 8 of the Convention about the investigation and inquiries made into their sexual orientation and about their subsequent discharge from the armed forces pursuant to the absolute policy against those of homosexual orientation in the armed forces. Article 8, insofar as relevant, read as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life, ... .2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety ..., for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”The Government accept that neither the applicants’ service records nor their conduct would give any grounds for complaint and that there is no evidence that, prior to the discovery of their sexual orientation, such orientation adversely affected the performance by them or by their colleagues of their duties. Nor is it contended by the Government that homosexuals are less physically capable, brave, dependable or skilled than heterosexuals. The Government also accept that there has been an interference with the applicants’ private lives and considers that the discharges were ‘in accordance with the law’.However, the Government underline the wide margin of appreciation which is properly open to a State in this context (Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, § 59) by reference to four matters. In the first place, they refer to the intense debate in recent years in the United Kingdom on the subject. Secondly, given the national security dimension and the special nature of life and duties in the armed forces, the complaints are made in a special armed forces’ context to which different and more stricter rules can apply (Engel v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A No. 22, , p. 24, § 57 and Kalaç v. Turkey judgment of 23 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, no. 41, p. 1209, § 28). Thirdly, the Government point out that the applicants are requesting the Court to interfere in a field which risks damaging the operational efficacy of the armed forces. Finally, it is argued that the diverse legal and practical positions in other countries as well as the comparatively recent legal changes in many of those countries indicate that the treatment of this controversial issue is still in a transitional period.The Government consider that the observations and conclusions in the HPAT Report of February 1996 demonstrate that the present policy is justifiable. The view that changing the policy at this time would involve a clear and unacceptable risk to fighting power and, consequently, to the effectiveness of the armed forces is, according to the Government, a reasonable and legitimate conclusion on a sensitive and controversial question. Further, it is a conclusion which is not undermined by the lack of a similar ban in other disciplined but civilian contexts in the United Kingdom or by the fact that certain other countries have changed their laws to admit homosexuals into their armed forces.The Government also deal in their observations with certain of the applicants’ submissions to the domestic courts. The applicants had claimed that there was no evidence that their or others’ homosexual orientation caused the type of problems anticipated by the HPAT. The Government point out that the discharge of all persons of established homosexual orientation ‘before such damage results’ means that concrete evidence establishing the risks identified by the HPAT may not be available. In any event, the Government note that the risks envisaged “would result from the general relaxation of the policy, rather than its modification in any particular instance”. The applicants had also argued in favour of a conduct based code. The Government note that this option was rejected by the HPAT on the basis that any such code would not avoid the real risk to the effectiveness of the armed forces because the risk was not dependent on homosexual conduct but on the “presence in the armed forces of those of known or strongly suspected homosexual orientation”.Finally, the Government explain that homosexuality will be investigated in order to ensure that personnel are not attempting to obtain early discharge on the basis of false representations of homosexuality. An investigation usually implies questioning the individual and seeking corroborative evidence and, given the nature of the subject matter, will necessarily cover intimate and personal issues. The Government also defend the conduct of the interviews pointing out that both applicants were informed at the outset that they did not have to say anything unless they wished to do so but they both, nevertheless, chose to co-operate.Accordingly, the Government submit that the interferences with the applicants’ private lives by the investigations and discharges were proportionate. In such circumstances, the Government argue that the applicants’ complaints are manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 35 § 3, or, in the alternative, do not give rise to a violation of the Convention.The applicants submit that both their investigation and discharge from the armed forces constituted serious interferences with their private lives for which the armed forces have not offered any objective or “particularly serious reasons” by way of justification (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. p. 21, § 52 and Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 22-23, §§ 42-44). They refer, inter alia, to their good service records and to the lack of any allegations of inappropriate conduct contrasted with the absolute nature of the policy against homosexuals (the only matter for which an absolute policy of discharge is pursued). They also contrast the position in foreign armed forces and in other civilian but disciplined forces. They note the contents of the HPAT Report observing that the main argument contained therein in favour of the policy (the maintenance of morale and fighting power) amounts to pandering to the prejudice of others against those of homosexual orientation. Indeed they note that the same argument could be used to exclude women, ethnic minorities and those of different religions.The applicants deal in some detail in their observations with the HPAT assessment and Report submitting that both are fundamentally flawed and unsustainable.In the first place, the applicants contend that the HPAT assessment is not objective and was designed to defend the continuation of the ban. Secondly, the methodology adopted by the HPAT is also suspect - the basic hypothesis upon which the assessment was based demonstrated prejudice and traditional stereo-typing of homosexual behaviour and the assessment set out to prove this flawed hypothesis. The phrasing of the questions in the questionnaire reinforced the “party line”, validated popular prejudice and induced fear in the respondents about a change in the policy. There were no guarantees of confidentiality as regards the responses and there was, in any event, a minimal response from service personnel. Thirdly, the conclusions drawn by the HPAT in its Report do not withstand scrutiny. The results are based entirely on group prejudice that does not reflect the reality of how individuals behave towards each other in practice. The HPAT ignored the considerable importance of information it had obtained from foreign armed forces and other British civilian disciplined forces. The HPAT also failed to take into account certain important factors including the responsibility of the armed forces to combat discrimination, the continued service of individuals of homosexual orientation in the armed forces, the experience of those who admitted their homosexuality, the reduction of the risk of blackmail, the cost implications of dismissing trained personnel, the fact that homosexuals served in both World Wars without effecting combat effectiveness and the views of the women in the armed forces who were largely in favour of lifting the ban. Moreover, certain factors were erroneously taken into account including the increased costs associated with combating discrimination and the \"image” of the services.As to Article 8 of the Convention specifically, the applicants argue, inter alia, that the Government must show that the ‘legitimate aim’ is achieved, at least to some extent, by the policy pursued. Since the reduction in fighting power cannot be sustained, then neither can the aim of national security. Insofar as the policy is aimed at the prevention of disorder arising from fears of harassment of homosexuals, then this cannot be accepted as a ‘legitimate’ aim, allowing as it does the exclusion of a minority group based on perceived fears of their harassment.As to the proportionality of the interferences, the applicants adopt the submissions in this respect of Mr Lustig-Prean (No. 31417/96, Dec. 23.2.99, as yet unpublished) before the Court adding that, such are the democratic ideals and the notion of respect and protection of individual rights upon which the Convention is founded, the prejudice of a majority can never constitute a justification for the infringement of minority rights. Moreover, the applicants add that, since the Government argue that it is the knowledge of homosexuality which would undermine morale and fighting power, had there been no investigation by the authorities, there would have been no such knowledge.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 8 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.4. Article 10 of the ConventionThe applicants further complain under Article 10 of the Convention about the limitation imposed by the policy on their right to give expression to their sexual identity. Article 10, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ... .2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, ... for the prevention of disorder ... .”The Government contend that freedom of expression is not an issue in these cases. The applicants were free to express information and ideas and to inform others of their sexual orientation. Their discharge was not a result of any expression of information or ideas - rather it was a consequence of the fact of their homosexuality which, until they came under investigation, they had chosen to conceal. In any event, any interference with the applicants’ freedom of expression was justified for the same reasons advanced by the Government in the context of Article 8 and, accordingly, no separate issue arises under Article 10.The applicants argue that the right to give expression to one’s sexuality encapsulates opinions, ideas and information essential to an individual and their identity. The policy forced the applicants to live secret lives denying them the simple opportunity to communicate openly and freely their own sexual identity which, in turn, had a chilling effect on them and was a powerful inhibiting factor in their right to express themselves. For the reasons outlined in the context of Article 8, the applicants submit that the interference with their right to freedom of expression did not have a legitimate aim and/or was not necessary and/or was not proportionate.In their observations, the applicants refer to the Government’s submission about their freedom to express their homosexuality as ‘hardly credible’. If the applicants had done so they would have been immediately investigated and dismissed and, in any event, that is what effectively happened. The applicants note that the Government rely, in this context, on the justification offered for the interferences with their private lives and that they make no attempt to provide justification for what is an extreme limitation on expression or for the substantial consequences suffered by the applicants for expressing their homosexuality.The applicants would add to their submissions under Article 8 § 2 that the expression of one’s homosexual orientation is a necessary and essential part of one’s sense of being, one’s existence as an individual and one’s self-fulfilment. Exceptions to the right of freedom of expression must be narrowly interpreted. Given the fact that expression which might shock, offend or disturb is protected, the mere fact that members of the armed forces would, as the Government submit, be upset by the presence of known homosexuals is insufficient justification for an interference under Article 10. The case of Kalaç v. Turkey (loc. cit) can be distinguished - the applicant in that case was able to express and practice his religious opinions and beliefs and he was discharged, not for his religious beliefs and opinions, but rather as a result of his conduct, the latter of which is not an issue in the present cases.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 10 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.5. Article 14 in conjunction with Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the ConventionThe applicants also invoke Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the Convention. Article 14, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:“ The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, ... political or other opinion, ... or other status.”The Government submit that the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 3 does not give rise to any separate issue. They also consider that there is no separate issue under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 25-26. §§ 64-70) or, in the alternative, that any difference in treatment is justified for the same reasons submitted in the context of Article 8 § 2.The applicants consider that they have been treated differently in relation to these Convention rights on the basis of “sex” (which should be interpreted to include sexual orientation) and/or “other status”. They submit that, even if the policy against homosexuals in the armed forces pursued a legitimate aim (which they dispute), it was not proportionate to aim sought to be realised.The applicants observe that the Government have not offered any added reasons to justify the difference in treatment. However, the case-law shows that the State must show “very weighty reasons” in order to establish justification for a difference in treatment (Abudulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 37-38, § 78 and Karlheinz Schmidt v. Germany judgment of 18 July 1994, Series A no. 291-B, p. 32, § 34) and that a narrow margin of appreciation applies in considering whether sufficient justification has been provided.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 14 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.6. Article 13 of the ConventionFinally, the applicants complain that the judicial review proceedings did not constitute an effective remedy, within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention, for the alleged violations of Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14. Article 13 reads, insofar as relevant, as follows:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority ... .”The Government submit, in the first place, that there is no arguable claim in relation to any of the applicants’ complaints. In any event, they argue, referring to the Vilvarajah case, that judicial review does provide an effective remedy (Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215). In particular, the substance of the Convention arguments could be, and was, advanced before the domestic courts and the same arguments relied on by the applicants before the Court were relied on by them before the domestic courts. They consider that any difference between the judicial review test and the margin of appreciation was not central to the issues in these cases and the essential reasoning of the Court of Appeal mirrors that which underpins the Convention margin of appreciation - both the domestic courts and the Convention organs retain a supervisory role to ensure that the State does not abuse its powers or exceed its margin of appreciation.The applicants submit that the test applied in the judicial review proceedings is too limited to provide an effective remedy. It is much wider than the margin of appreciation accorded to States and cannot take account of the requirements of objective justification and proportionality of interferences with individual rights.The applicants also contend that the Government’s arguments are not sustainable. Their complaints are clearly arguable. Moreover, the Court of Appeal expressly rejected its jurisdiction to consider arguments under Article 8 of the Convention including issues such as ‘pressing social need’ and proportionality. Moreover, it was clear that the large difference between the margin of appreciation and the “high” standard of irrationality which had to be applied by the Court of Appeal was the main reason why that court was obliged to dismiss the judicial review applications despite having considered the applicants’ submissions persuasive.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 13, in connection with Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14 of the Convention, which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the applicants’ complaints under Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention;DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the cases, the remainder of the applications.S.

       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 1384, 'The Law': '1. The applicant complains that his deportation to Croatia would involve a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, which provision reads as follows:“Collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited.”The Court finds that collective expulsion is to be understood as any measure compelling aliens, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group. Moreover, the fact that a number of aliens receive similar decisions does not lead to the conclusion that there is a collective expulsion when each person concerned has been given the opportunity to put arguments against his expulsion to the competent authorities on an individual basis (see application no. 14209/88, decision of 16 December 1988, DR 59, p. 274).In the present case, the Court notes that the Swedish Government issued guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications submitted by persons holding both Bosnian and Croatian citizenship. Furthermore, in examining the applicant’s case, the National Immigration Board and the Aliens Appeals Board had regard to the general situation for persons with the applicant’s background in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.However, the applicant submitted individual applications to the immigration authorities and was able to present any arguments he wished to make against his possible deportation to the respective countries. The authorities took into account not only the general situation in the countries but also the applicant’s statements concerning his own background and the risks allegedly facing him upon return. In rejecting his applications, the authorities issued individual decisions concerning the applicant’s situation.In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant’s possible deportation does not reveal any appearance of a collective expulsion within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.2. The Court finds that the present application should be examined also under Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”The Court recalls that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens. However, an expulsion decision may give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, and hence engage the responsibility of the State, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country to which he or she is to be expelled (see, among other authorities,the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no.215, p. 34, §§ 102-103). A mere possibility of ill-treatment is not in itself sufficient (ibid., p. 37, § 111).In the present case, the Court recalls that the Swedish immigration authorities have ordered the applicant’s deportation to Bosnia-Hercegovina or Croatia. Apparently, the applicant is an ethnic Croat from Bosnia-Hercegovina. Furthermore, the applicant holds double citizenship. Having regard to the applicant’s statements and the conclusions drawn by the Swedish Government and the UNHCR the Court cannot find that he will be subjected to ill-treatment if returned to his home district in Bosnia-Hercegovina or to Croatia. In this connection, the Court finds that even if the applicant were to serve the five-year prison sentence for desertion he has allegedly received, this does not amount to ill-treatment falling under Article 3 of the Convention. Thus, the Court considers that there are not substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if returned to either of the countries in question.However, without making a special reference in his complaint, the applicant has submitted a medical certificate showing that he is suffering from a post-traumatic stress syndrome and that there is a considerable risk of his attempting to commit suicide should he be deported from Sweden. In this connection, the Court notes that, in assessing whether a deportation involves such a trauma that it in itself constitutes a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, its physical and mental effects and the state of health of the person concerned are to be taken into account (see Eur. Court HR, Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 31, §§ 83-84, and the opinion of the Commission, p. 87, §§ 87-90).In so far as the applicant’s mental problems relate to his fear of what will happen to him upon return to Bosnia-Hercegovina or Croatia, the Court recalls its above finding that no substantial basis has been shown for this fear. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that the police authority in charge of the enforcement of the deportation order will take into account the applicant’s state of health when deciding how the deportation is to be carried out. In this connection, it is to be noted that, should the applicant be taken into compulsory psychiatric care due to his mental problems, the deportation could under no circumstances take place without the permission of the chief physician responsible for his care (see application no. 27249/95, decision of 14 September 1995, DR 83, p. 91). The Court notes further that the applicant has been discharged from the psychiatric clinic where he previously received treatment.In these circumstances, the Court does not find it established that the applicant’s deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of his present state of health.It follows that this part of the application is also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Michael O’Boyle Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-02-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4521', 'appno': '45920/99', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'SWE', 'extractedappno': '45920/99;14209/88;27249/95', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '341;350;193', 'doc_id': 'a9492e5a-0beb-4cdf-932e-ef7106d7bfea'}, page_content='to Croatia.

       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 13259, 'The Law': 'The respondent Government have in their submissions to the Court raised a number of objections to the admissibility of the application. The Court will examine the objections under the following headings:I. The scope of the application;II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç;III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practice.I. The scope of the applicationThe respondent Government maintain that the “invitation” of the applicant Government in respect of interrogation techniques in Turkey is not the object of the complaint and thus falls outside the scope of the application. The applicant Government dispute this.The Court recalls that under Article 33 of the Convention any High Contracting Party may refer to the Court any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party. The Court observes that the applicant Government complain that the ill-treatment of Mr Koç does not appear to be an isolated incident, but rather just one example of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey, inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention and invite the Court to examine whether this is in fact the case. The Court finds that the contents of the application and the written and oral submissions are sufficiently clear and precise for a judicial examination under the Convention also on this point. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application concerns not only the specific situation of Mr Koç but also, as an additional and separate complaint, the allegation of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey.II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç.The Court recalls Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which reads as follows:“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, embodied in the above provision, applies to State applications (Article 33) in the same way as it does to “individual” applications (Article 34), when the applicant State does no more than denounce a violation or violations allegedly suffered by individuals whose place is taken by the State (cf. e.g. the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series of no. 25, p. 64, §159). Accordingly, in order to examine the complaints made on behalf of Mr Koç, the Court must in principle first examine whether the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies has been complied with.The Court agrees with the respondent Government that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. This is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. This is, inter alia, the case where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance thereof by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (ibid.).In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is furthermore a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non‑exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant - in the specific case the applicant Government - to establish that the remedy advanced was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see e.g. the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, § 68).In the present case the Court recalls that the respondent Government maintain that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with, in particular since criminal proceedings are at present pending before the Court of Cassation where the allegations made by Mr Koç will be examined and, if necessary, redressed. The applicant Government maintain, however, that this remedy is inadequate and ineffective, in particular since the allegations concern an administrative practice of ill-treatment of persons in police custody.The Court finds that the question of whether the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies applies or has been satisfied in the present case raises issues which are so closely related to the question of the existence of an administrative practice that, to avoid prejudging the latter, both issues should be examined together. It recalls, however, that at the stage of admissibility, in inter-State cases, it is not the Court’s task to carry out a preliminary examination of the merits, since the provisions of Article 35 - empowering it to declare inadmissible petitions which it considers either incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or manifestly ill-founded - apply only to individual applications under Article 34. Consequently, any examination of the merits of the application must in such cases be reserved for the post-admissibility stage.Accordingly, the Court considers that the final determination of the issue concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç should be joined to the merits and reserved for later consideration.III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practiceThe Court recalls that, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant Government complain of an alleged practice of ill-treatment. They submit that persons in police custody have been tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. They have adduced evidence to show that, during the period covered by this application, torture or ill‑treatment are not merely isolated incidents or exceptions, but so widespread and applied in such a systematic manner as to constitute an administrative practice in the meaning of the case-law of the Court. The applicant Government maintain that the rule of the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application.While generally stating that the facts are not admitted, the respondent Government have not offered any counter-evidence or made comments on the material presented by the applicant Government.The Court recalls that in principle the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply where the applicant State complains of a practice as such, with the aim of preventing its continuation or recurrence (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 64, § 159). The Court notes that in respect of this part of the application, leaving aside the particular situation of Mr Koç as set out above, the applicant Government have not asked the Court to give a decision on any individual case and it follows therefore that the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application. In addition, the Court finds from the evidence submitted that the allegation made by the applicant Government is not wholly unsubstantiated or otherwise, as set out above, lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation in the sense of Article 33 of the Convention. The further examination, however, of all other questions regarding the existence and extent of such an administrative practice and its consistency with the provisions of the Convention relate to the merits and cannot, therefore, be considered by the Court at the stage of admissibility.Finally the Court notes that the applicant Government have requested the Court to examine the period from 1 January 1996 until today.The Court considers that an issue may arise as to whether it can examine a period which goes back further than six months from the date of introduction of the application. However, as the questions relating to the six-month rule in the present circumstances are also closely linked to the questions concerning the existence and extent of the alleged administrative practice, the answers thereto would again imply a preliminary examination of the merits of the case. The Court therefore reserves these questions for later consideration.It follows that the applicant Government’s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 1 and Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, by a majority,JOINS TO THE MERITS, the questions relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç and the six-month ruleandDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.Michael O’Boyle Elisabeth Palm Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-06-08 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4644', 'appno': '34382/97', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'TUR', 'extractedappno': '34382/97;1996/74', 'conclusion': 'Admissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;193;567;197;14;128;109;471', 'doc_id': '7165ed69-e979-4a0b-a836-dad06f91b6f2'}, page_content='changes that may take place in the evidence, and provided that the defendant is not convicted orarrested for another crime, he should be released promptly; and a letter to this effect should be sent to the Prosecution of the State Security Court; (For this item only Judge Captain Tanju Güvendiren has expressed his opposition.)4. for these reasons, and taking into consideration the letters to be written and for their replies, the case was adjourned until 19 September 1996, at 11:00.”As set out above Mr Koç returned to Denmark on 16 August 1996.

The applicant complains that the Hungarian authorities’ procedure concerning his request for asylum and his potential deportation amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.Article 3 of the Convention provides that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.Article 34, so far as relevant, provides that the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols thereto.The Government submit that on 25 January 1999 the Office ruled that, in pursuance of S. 32 § 1 of the 1993 Aliens Act, the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt. According to S. 25 of Government Decree no. 64/1994, the applicant should not in the future be deported from Hungarian territory as long as the relevant situation in his country of origin persists, i.e. the reasons prohibiting his expulsion cease to exist. For the duration of the asylum proceedings, he is authorised to reside in Hungary. A temporary residence permit will be issued to him, should he not be granted refugee status in the court proceedings. In these circumstances the Government are of the view that the applicant’s complaint has lost relevance.The applicant submits that the applicant’s forcible return to Egypt, as attempted by the Hungarian authorities notwithstanding that his court action was pending, could have resulted in his expulsion to Iraq and thus could have exposed him to a treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, the absence of a thorough investigation into his statements in the asylum proceedings and, in particular, the fact that the Hungarian authorities did not prevent the Iraqi consul from interfering with their proceedings amounted to another violation of Article 3. Unless he will be granted asylum in the pending court proceedings, the issue of his subsistence in Hungary is not resolved, since the certificate to be issued under S. 25 of Government Decree no. 64/1994 would not guarantee him any legal status with a view to staying in Hungary.The Court observes that on 25 January 1999 the Office decided that the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it is not called upon to examine the applicant’s complaints concerning his attempted return to Egypt or the alleged shortcomings of the asylum proceedings. Since the applicant is not exposed any more to the imminent danger of being expelled to a country where he might be subjected to a treatment in breach of Article 3, he can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under that Article within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.2. The applicant also complains under Article 13 read in conjunction with Article 3 of the Convention that there was no effective remedy at his disposal to challenge the denial of a refugee status and his attempted forcible return to Egypt since the court action to challenge the lawfulness of the administrative proceedings had no suspensive effect.Article 13 of the Convention provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.The Court notes that in the decision of 22 December 1998 it was specified that an action to challenge the lawfulness of the asylum proceedings was of no suspensive effect concerning the applicant’s return to Cairo as ordered and, moreover, that subsequently the Hungarian authorities attempted to execute his return, notwithstanding the fact that his action had meanwhile been filed with the Budapest Regional Court. The question arises, therefore, whether - when introducing his application - the applicant had at his disposal a remedy before the national authorities concerning his deportation which could be considered effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.However, as set out above in regard to his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant is no longer exposed to the threat of imminent expulsion from Hungary. In the light of this development in the case, his pending court action for asylum can now be regarded as capable of redressing his claim. Consequently, this remedy cannot be held ineffective for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is likewise manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.3. Lastly, the applicant complains that his detention at the Communal Accommodation of the Budapest Border Guards Directorate amounted to a deprivation of liberty contrary to Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 in that it was not ordered in a manner satisfactorily prescribed by law and could not be appealed to a judicial body.Article 5 §§ 1 and 4, so far as relevant, provide:“1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...f. the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition. …4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.”Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, so far as relevant, provides that the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law.The Government submit that the Communal Accommodation was lawfully designated as the applicant’s compulsory place of residence under S. 43 of the 1993 Aliens Act. Paragraph 5 of that Section provides that the judicial review of an order designating a compulsory place of residence can be requested from the courts. According to Ss. 39 to 42, such review may be requested at any time during detention. In the court proceedings the claimant must be heard in person and the court’s decisions is subject to appeal. Section 50 provides that the courts shall proceed speedily in these matters. Since, however, the applicant has not availed himself of this remedy, his complaints should be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.The applicant submits that the domestic legal provisions on the designation of a foreigner’s compulsory place of residence are not clear enough to meet the criteria of accessibility and precision. In the light of the non-suspensive effect of the request for the judicial review of the deportation order, the applicant could not have recourse to a remedy, effective for the purposes of Article 5 § 4, to challenge the lawfulness of the deprivation of his liberty. In any event, such a remedy could have been pursued only under the relevant rules of the Code of Civil Procedure: to achieve a judicial review of the impugned administrative decision, a proper action must have been brought in default of which the request might have been rejected without an examination on the merits. In a situation where legal assistance was hardly available, the relevant formal requirements rendered this remedy virtually inaccessible. Furthermore, due to the courts’ heavy workload, the proceedings in question may have lasted for months, contrary to the requirement of speediness under Article 5 § 4.The Court considers that it is not called upon to decide whether the applicant’s commitment to the Communal Accommodation amounted to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention or whether it was ordered lawfully, since these complaints are in any event inadmissible for the reasons set out below.The Court recalls that the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 19, § 36). The Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines (see the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 30-31, § 66). Where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a domestic remedy, that remedy must be tried (cf., e.g., No. 13669/88, Dec. 7.3.90, D. R. 65, p. 245).In the present case the Court observes that S. 43 § 5 of the 1993 Aliens Act provides that a judicial review of an administrative decision ordering a foreigner’s compulsory place of residence may be requested from the competent court. However, the applicant did not avail himself of this remedy. The Court finds that mere doubts as to the outcome or the length of the court proceedings in question did not exempt the applicant from having to exhaust the domestic remedy available to him.It follows that this part of the application must be rejected under Article 35 § 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Erik Fribergh Marc Fischbach Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-05-04 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4570', 'appno': '45163/99', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'HUN', 'extractedappno': '45163/99;13669/88', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '183;498;14;128;444;110;350;448', 'doc_id': 'd00be02f-afac-4867-a4c8-b7a49785e09d'}, page_content='is issued; or (c) this is necessary for the purposes of guaranteeing the execution of an expulsion, until the establishment of the conditions of expulsion; or (d) his return was ordered (see S. 25 above); or (e) his return or expulsion should take place, but he may not be returned or expelled in accordance with the prohibition under S. 32 § 1.The compulsory place of residence may also be designated at a communal accommodation, if the foreigner is not able to support himself, and no appropriate accommodation, financial means, income and inviting party or relatives obliged to'), -33.211273193359375), (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 13259, 'The Law': 'The respondent Government have in their submissions to the Court raised a number of objections to the admissibility of the application. The Court will examine the objections under the following headings:I. The scope of the application;II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç;III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practice.I. The scope of the applicationThe respondent Government maintain that the “invitation” of the applicant Government in respect of interrogation techniques in Turkey is not the object of the complaint and thus falls outside the scope of the application. The applicant Government dispute this.The Court recalls that under Article 33 of the Convention any High Contracting Party may refer to the Court any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party. The Court observes that the applicant Government complain that the ill-treatment of Mr Koç does not appear to be an isolated incident, but rather just one example of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey, inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention and invite the Court to examine whether this is in fact the case. The Court finds that the contents of the application and the written and oral submissions are sufficiently clear and precise for a judicial examination under the Convention also on this point. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application concerns not only the specific situation of Mr Koç but also, as an additional and separate complaint, the allegation of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey.II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç.The Court recalls Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which reads as follows:“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, embodied in the above provision, applies to State applications (Article 33) in the same way as it does to “individual” applications (Article 34), when the applicant State does no more than denounce a violation or violations allegedly suffered by individuals whose place is taken by the State (cf. e.g. the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series of no. 25, p. 64, §159). Accordingly, in order to examine the complaints made on behalf of Mr Koç, the Court must in principle first examine whether the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies has been complied with.The Court agrees with the respondent Government that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. This is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. This is, inter alia, the case where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance thereof by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (ibid.).In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is furthermore a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non‑exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant - in the specific case the applicant Government - to establish that the remedy advanced was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see e.g. the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, § 68).In the present case the Court recalls that the respondent Government maintain that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with, in particular since criminal proceedings are at present pending before the Court of Cassation where the allegations made by Mr Koç will be examined and, if necessary, redressed. The applicant Government maintain, however, that this remedy is inadequate and ineffective, in particular since the allegations concern an administrative practice of ill-treatment of persons in police custody.The Court finds that the question of whether the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies applies or has been satisfied in the present case raises issues which are so closely related to the question of the existence of an administrative practice that, to avoid prejudging the latter, both issues should be examined together. It recalls, however, that at the stage of admissibility, in inter-State cases, it is not the Court’s task to carry out a preliminary examination of the merits, since the provisions of Article 35 - empowering it to declare inadmissible petitions which it considers either incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or manifestly ill-founded - apply only to individual applications under Article 34. Consequently, any examination of the merits of the application must in such cases be reserved for the post-admissibility stage.Accordingly, the Court considers that the final determination of the issue concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç should be joined to the merits and reserved for later consideration.III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practiceThe Court recalls that, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant Government complain of an alleged practice of ill-treatment. They submit that persons in police custody have been tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. They have adduced evidence to show that, during the period covered by this application, torture or ill‑treatment are not merely isolated incidents or exceptions, but so widespread and applied in such a systematic manner as to constitute an administrative practice in the meaning of the case-law of the Court. The applicant Government maintain that the rule of the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application.While generally stating that the facts are not admitted, the respondent Government have not offered any counter-evidence or made comments on the material presented by the applicant Government.The Court recalls that in principle the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply where the applicant State complains of a practice as such, with the aim of preventing its continuation or recurrence (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 64, § 159). The Court notes that in respect of this part of the application, leaving aside the particular situation of Mr Koç as set out above, the applicant Government have not asked the Court to give a decision on any individual case and it follows therefore that the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application. In addition, the Court finds from the evidence submitted that the allegation made by the applicant Government is not wholly unsubstantiated or otherwise, as set out above, lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation in the sense of Article 33 of the Convention. The further examination, however, of all other questions regarding the existence and extent of such an administrative practice and its consistency with the provisions of the Convention relate to the merits and cannot, therefore, be considered by the Court at the stage of admissibility.Finally the Court notes that the applicant Government have requested the Court to examine the period from 1 January 1996 until today.The Court considers that an issue may arise as to whether it can examine a period which goes back further than six months from the date of introduction of the application. However, as the questions relating to the six-month rule in the present circumstances are also closely linked to the questions concerning the existence and extent of the alleged administrative practice, the answers thereto would again imply a preliminary examination of the merits of the case. The Court therefore reserves these questions for later consideration.It follows that the applicant Government’s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 1 and Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, by a majority,JOINS TO THE MERITS, the questions relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç and the six-month ruleandDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.Michael O’Boyle Elisabeth Palm Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-06-08 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4644', 'appno': '34382/97', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'TUR', 'extractedappno': '34382/97;1996/74', 'conclusion': 'Admissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;193;567;197;14;128;109;471', 'doc_id': '7165ed69-e979-4a0b-a836-dad06f91b6f2'}, page_content='legal association;2. as the defendant Kemal Koç has stated that he took part in the Kurdish National Assembly in Germany in 1992 as a delegate, it should be determined whether this is true or not, the information and documents, if available, particularly from the point of view of the defendant’s participation at the meeting, should be requested from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Ministry of Justice;3. taking into consideration the nature of the crime of which the defendant Kemal Koç is accused and considering the possibility of the changes that may take place in the evidence, and provided'), -33.495277404785156), (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 6697, 'The Law': 'The applicants complain that the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces of the United Kingdom violated their rights under Articles 3, 5, 8 and 10, alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. They also consider that they did not have an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 in respect of the alleged violations of Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14 of the Convention1. Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the ConventionThe first applicant complains about being detained by the armed forces authorities on 15 June 1994 and thereafter. The second applicant complains about being detained on 17 May 1994, during his interviews under caution on 25 and 26 May 1994 and thereafter. Both invoke Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 in these respects. Article 5 of the Convention guarantees the right to liberty and security of person and Article 14 ensures freedom from discrimination in the securement of Convention rights (see p. 18 below).However, the Court notes that applicants were definitively discharged from the air force on 16 November and 16 December 1994, respectively and that the domestic proceedings pursued by them did not relate to any detention matters. Accordingly, even assuming that the applicants could demonstrate a form of detention within the meaning of Article 5 during and/or after the investigation of their homosexuality by the armed forces authorities, and even if the six-month time-limit set down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention began to run for both applicants from the date of their discharge from the armed forces, their respective applications have been introduced (on 9 and 6 September 1996, respectively) outside of this time-limit.In such circumstances, their complaints as regards alleged periods of detention prior to their discharge from the armed forces under Articles 5 and 14 of the Convention are inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.2. Article 3 of the ConventionThe applicants complain that the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces and the consequent investigations and discharges amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. In addition, they submit that their discriminatory treatment, based on crude stereotyping and prejudice, denied and caused affront to their individuality and dignity (Nos. 4403/70 et subs, East African Asians v. the United Kingdom, Comm. Report 14.12.73, D.R. 78-A) and, as such, amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3. This Article reads, insofar as relevant, as follows:\"No one shall be subjected to ... degrading treatment or punishment.\"The Government submit that, given the serious and reasonable basis and aim of the policy (maintaining the fighting power and effectiveness of the armed forces) and in the absence of any intention to degrade or humiliate, the policy cannot be categorised as degrading. They would distinguish the above-cited East African Asians case since that case dealt with racial discrimination. They also defend the investigation procedure arguing that the aim is not to humiliate persons but to deal with cases as quickly and as discreetly as possible. The applicants chose to answer questions having been informed of their right not to so answer. Indeed the second applicant exercised for a period of time his rights not to answer and to have a lawyer present. Given the matter at issue, intimate questions are inevitable in the investigation process and the Government clarify that no reference is made in the discharge certificate to sexual orientation.In response, the applicants point out that it is sufficient if the victim is “humiliated in his own eyes” (Tyer v. United Kingdom judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 16, § 32). As to the East African Asians case, the distinction made by the Government is a technical one - they were labelled and categorised, which process debases and denigrates an individual’s existence and character. Moreover, treatment contrary to Article 3 cannot ever have a justification. As to the suggestion that the applicants could have chosen not to participate in the interviews, they submit that their complaint relates to the entire investigation and dismissal process, the caution given was in fact the standard caution given to a criminal suspect, the fact that questions were put was hurtful and degrading, and the absence of a legal obligation to answer the questions in no way mitigated that effect. In any event, the questions extended significantly beyond an inquiry into sexual orientation - the questioning continued after both applicants admitted their sexual orientation and included allegations that were offensive and unfounded.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 3 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.3. Article 8 of the ConventionThe applicants also complain under Article 8 of the Convention about the investigation and inquiries made into their sexual orientation and about their subsequent discharge from the armed forces pursuant to the absolute policy against those of homosexual orientation in the armed forces. Article 8, insofar as relevant, read as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life, ... .2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety ..., for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”The Government accept that neither the applicants’ service records nor their conduct would give any grounds for complaint and that there is no evidence that, prior to the discovery of their sexual orientation, such orientation adversely affected the performance by them or by their colleagues of their duties. Nor is it contended by the Government that homosexuals are less physically capable, brave, dependable or skilled than heterosexuals. The Government also accept that there has been an interference with the applicants’ private lives and considers that the discharges were ‘in accordance with the law’.However, the Government underline the wide margin of appreciation which is properly open to a State in this context (Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, § 59) by reference to four matters. In the first place, they refer to the intense debate in recent years in the United Kingdom on the subject. Secondly, given the national security dimension and the special nature of life and duties in the armed forces, the complaints are made in a special armed forces’ context to which different and more stricter rules can apply (Engel v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A No. 22, , p. 24, § 57 and Kalaç v. Turkey judgment of 23 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, no. 41, p. 1209, § 28). Thirdly, the Government point out that the applicants are requesting the Court to interfere in a field which risks damaging the operational efficacy of the armed forces. Finally, it is argued that the diverse legal and practical positions in other countries as well as the comparatively recent legal changes in many of those countries indicate that the treatment of this controversial issue is still in a transitional period.The Government consider that the observations and conclusions in the HPAT Report of February 1996 demonstrate that the present policy is justifiable. The view that changing the policy at this time would involve a clear and unacceptable risk to fighting power and, consequently, to the effectiveness of the armed forces is, according to the Government, a reasonable and legitimate conclusion on a sensitive and controversial question. Further, it is a conclusion which is not undermined by the lack of a similar ban in other disciplined but civilian contexts in the United Kingdom or by the fact that certain other countries have changed their laws to admit homosexuals into their armed forces.The Government also deal in their observations with certain of the applicants’ submissions to the domestic courts. The applicants had claimed that there was no evidence that their or others’ homosexual orientation caused the type of problems anticipated by the HPAT. The Government point out that the discharge of all persons of established homosexual orientation ‘before such damage results’ means that concrete evidence establishing the risks identified by the HPAT may not be available. In any event, the Government note that the risks envisaged “would result from the general relaxation of the policy, rather than its modification in any particular instance”. The applicants had also argued in favour of a conduct based code. The Government note that this option was rejected by the HPAT on the basis that any such code would not avoid the real risk to the effectiveness of the armed forces because the risk was not dependent on homosexual conduct but on the “presence in the armed forces of those of known or strongly suspected homosexual orientation”.Finally, the Government explain that homosexuality will be investigated in order to ensure that personnel are not attempting to obtain early discharge on the basis of false representations of homosexuality. An investigation usually implies questioning the individual and seeking corroborative evidence and, given the nature of the subject matter, will necessarily cover intimate and personal issues. The Government also defend the conduct of the interviews pointing out that both applicants were informed at the outset that they did not have to say anything unless they wished to do so but they both, nevertheless, chose to co-operate.Accordingly, the Government submit that the interferences with the applicants’ private lives by the investigations and discharges were proportionate. In such circumstances, the Government argue that the applicants’ complaints are manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 35 § 3, or, in the alternative, do not give rise to a violation of the Convention.The applicants submit that both their investigation and discharge from the armed forces constituted serious interferences with their private lives for which the armed forces have not offered any objective or “particularly serious reasons” by way of justification (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. p. 21, § 52 and Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 22-23, §§ 42-44). They refer, inter alia, to their good service records and to the lack of any allegations of inappropriate conduct contrasted with the absolute nature of the policy against homosexuals (the only matter for which an absolute policy of discharge is pursued). They also contrast the position in foreign armed forces and in other civilian but disciplined forces. They note the contents of the HPAT Report observing that the main argument contained therein in favour of the policy (the maintenance of morale and fighting power) amounts to pandering to the prejudice of others against those of homosexual orientation. Indeed they note that the same argument could be used to exclude women, ethnic minorities and those of different religions.The applicants deal in some detail in their observations with the HPAT assessment and Report submitting that both are fundamentally flawed and unsustainable.In the first place, the applicants contend that the HPAT assessment is not objective and was designed to defend the continuation of the ban. Secondly, the methodology adopted by the HPAT is also suspect - the basic hypothesis upon which the assessment was based demonstrated prejudice and traditional stereo-typing of homosexual behaviour and the assessment set out to prove this flawed hypothesis. The phrasing of the questions in the questionnaire reinforced the “party line”, validated popular prejudice and induced fear in the respondents about a change in the policy. There were no guarantees of confidentiality as regards the responses and there was, in any event, a minimal response from service personnel. Thirdly, the conclusions drawn by the HPAT in its Report do not withstand scrutiny. The results are based entirely on group prejudice that does not reflect the reality of how individuals behave towards each other in practice. The HPAT ignored the considerable importance of information it had obtained from foreign armed forces and other British civilian disciplined forces. The HPAT also failed to take into account certain important factors including the responsibility of the armed forces to combat discrimination, the continued service of individuals of homosexual orientation in the armed forces, the experience of those who admitted their homosexuality, the reduction of the risk of blackmail, the cost implications of dismissing trained personnel, the fact that homosexuals served in both World Wars without effecting combat effectiveness and the views of the women in the armed forces who were largely in favour of lifting the ban. Moreover, certain factors were erroneously taken into account including the increased costs associated with combating discrimination and the \"image” of the services.As to Article 8 of the Convention specifically, the applicants argue, inter alia, that the Government must show that the ‘legitimate aim’ is achieved, at least to some extent, by the policy pursued. Since the reduction in fighting power cannot be sustained, then neither can the aim of national security. Insofar as the policy is aimed at the prevention of disorder arising from fears of harassment of homosexuals, then this cannot be accepted as a ‘legitimate’ aim, allowing as it does the exclusion of a minority group based on perceived fears of their harassment.As to the proportionality of the interferences, the applicants adopt the submissions in this respect of Mr Lustig-Prean (No. 31417/96, Dec. 23.2.99, as yet unpublished) before the Court adding that, such are the democratic ideals and the notion of respect and protection of individual rights upon which the Convention is founded, the prejudice of a majority can never constitute a justification for the infringement of minority rights. Moreover, the applicants add that, since the Government argue that it is the knowledge of homosexuality which would undermine morale and fighting power, had there been no investigation by the authorities, there would have been no such knowledge.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 8 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.4. Article 10 of the ConventionThe applicants further complain under Article 10 of the Convention about the limitation imposed by the policy on their right to give expression to their sexual identity. Article 10, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ... .2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, ... for the prevention of disorder ... .”The Government contend that freedom of expression is not an issue in these cases. The applicants were free to express information and ideas and to inform others of their sexual orientation. Their discharge was not a result of any expression of information or ideas - rather it was a consequence of the fact of their homosexuality which, until they came under investigation, they had chosen to conceal. In any event, any interference with the applicants’ freedom of expression was justified for the same reasons advanced by the Government in the context of Article 8 and, accordingly, no separate issue arises under Article 10.The applicants argue that the right to give expression to one’s sexuality encapsulates opinions, ideas and information essential to an individual and their identity. The policy forced the applicants to live secret lives denying them the simple opportunity to communicate openly and freely their own sexual identity which, in turn, had a chilling effect on them and was a powerful inhibiting factor in their right to express themselves. For the reasons outlined in the context of Article 8, the applicants submit that the interference with their right to freedom of expression did not have a legitimate aim and/or was not necessary and/or was not proportionate.In their observations, the applicants refer to the Government’s submission about their freedom to express their homosexuality as ‘hardly credible’. If the applicants had done so they would have been immediately investigated and dismissed and, in any event, that is what effectively happened. The applicants note that the Government rely, in this context, on the justification offered for the interferences with their private lives and that they make no attempt to provide justification for what is an extreme limitation on expression or for the substantial consequences suffered by the applicants for expressing their homosexuality.The applicants would add to their submissions under Article 8 § 2 that the expression of one’s homosexual orientation is a necessary and essential part of one’s sense of being, one’s existence as an individual and one’s self-fulfilment. Exceptions to the right of freedom of expression must be narrowly interpreted. Given the fact that expression which might shock, offend or disturb is protected, the mere fact that members of the armed forces would, as the Government submit, be upset by the presence of known homosexuals is insufficient justification for an interference under Article 10. The case of Kalaç v. Turkey (loc. cit) can be distinguished - the applicant in that case was able to express and practice his religious opinions and beliefs and he was discharged, not for his religious beliefs and opinions, but rather as a result of his conduct, the latter of which is not an issue in the present cases.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 10 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.5. Article 14 in conjunction with Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the ConventionThe applicants also invoke Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the Convention. Article 14, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:“ The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, ... political or other opinion, ... or other status.”The Government submit that the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 3 does not give rise to any separate issue. They also consider that there is no separate issue under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 25-26. §§ 64-70) or, in the alternative, that any difference in treatment is justified for the same reasons submitted in the context of Article 8 § 2.The applicants consider that they have been treated differently in relation to these Convention rights on the basis of “sex” (which should be interpreted to include sexual orientation) and/or “other status”. They submit that, even if the policy against homosexuals in the armed forces pursued a legitimate aim (which they dispute), it was not proportionate to aim sought to be realised.The applicants observe that the Government have not offered any added reasons to justify the difference in treatment. However, the case-law shows that the State must show “very weighty reasons” in order to establish justification for a difference in treatment (Abudulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 37-38, § 78 and Karlheinz Schmidt v. Germany judgment of 18 July 1994, Series A no. 291-B, p. 32, § 34) and that a narrow margin of appreciation applies in considering whether sufficient justification has been provided.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 14 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.6. Article 13 of the ConventionFinally, the applicants complain that the judicial review proceedings did not constitute an effective remedy, within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention, for the alleged violations of Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14. Article 13 reads, insofar as relevant, as follows:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority ... .”The Government submit, in the first place, that there is no arguable claim in relation to any of the applicants’ complaints. In any event, they argue, referring to the Vilvarajah case, that judicial review does provide an effective remedy (Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215). In particular, the substance of the Convention arguments could be, and was, advanced before the domestic courts and the same arguments relied on by the applicants before the Court were relied on by them before the domestic courts. They consider that any difference between the judicial review test and the margin of appreciation was not central to the issues in these cases and the essential reasoning of the Court of Appeal mirrors that which underpins the Convention margin of appreciation - both the domestic courts and the Convention organs retain a supervisory role to ensure that the State does not abuse its powers or exceed its margin of appreciation.The applicants submit that the test applied in the judicial review proceedings is too limited to provide an effective remedy. It is much wider than the margin of appreciation accorded to States and cannot take account of the requirements of objective justification and proportionality of interferences with individual rights.The applicants also contend that the Government’s arguments are not sustainable. Their complaints are clearly arguable. Moreover, the Court of Appeal expressly rejected its jurisdiction to consider arguments under Article 8 of the Convention including issues such as ‘pressing social need’ and proportionality. Moreover, it was clear that the large difference between the margin of appreciation and the “high” standard of irrationality which had to be applied by the Court of Appeal was the main reason why that court was obliged to dismiss the judicial review applications despite having considered the applicants’ submissions persuasive.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 13, in connection with Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14 of the Convention, which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the applicants’ complaints under Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention;DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the cases, the remainder of the applications.S.

The applicant complains that his deportation to Croatia would involve a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, which provision reads as follows:“Collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited.”The Court finds that collective expulsion is to be understood as any measure compelling aliens, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group. Moreover, the fact that a number of aliens receive similar decisions does not lead to the conclusion that there is a collective expulsion when each person concerned has been given the opportunity to put arguments against his expulsion to the competent authorities on an individual basis (see application no. 14209/88, decision of 16 December 1988, DR 59, p. 274).In the present case, the Court notes that the Swedish Government issued guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications submitted by persons holding both Bosnian and Croatian citizenship. Furthermore, in examining the applicant’s case, the National Immigration Board and the Aliens Appeals Board had regard to the general situation for persons with the applicant’s background in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.However, the applicant submitted individual applications to the immigration authorities and was able to present any arguments he wished to make against his possible deportation to the respective countries. The authorities took into account not only the general situation in the countries but also the applicant’s statements concerning his own background and the risks allegedly facing him upon return. In rejecting his applications, the authorities issued individual decisions concerning the applicant’s situation.In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant’s possible deportation does not reveal any appearance of a collective expulsion within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.2. The Court finds that the present application should be examined also under Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”The Court recalls that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens. However, an expulsion decision may give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, and hence engage the responsibility of the State, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country to which he or she is to be expelled (see, among other authorities,the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no.215, p. 34, §§ 102-103). A mere possibility of ill-treatment is not in itself sufficient (ibid., p. 37, § 111).In the present case, the Court recalls that the Swedish immigration authorities have ordered the applicant’s deportation to Bosnia-Hercegovina or Croatia. Apparently, the applicant is an ethnic Croat from Bosnia-Hercegovina. Furthermore, the applicant holds double citizenship. Having regard to the applicant’s statements and the conclusions drawn by the Swedish Government and the UNHCR the Court cannot find that he will be subjected to ill-treatment if returned to his home district in Bosnia-Hercegovina or to Croatia. In this connection, the Court finds that even if the applicant were to serve the five-year prison sentence for desertion he has allegedly received, this does not amount to ill-treatment falling under Article 3 of the Convention. Thus, the Court considers that there are not substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if returned to either of the countries in question.However, without making a special reference in his complaint, the applicant has submitted a medical certificate showing that he is suffering from a post-traumatic stress syndrome and that there is a considerable risk of his attempting to commit suicide should he be deported from Sweden. In this connection, the Court notes that, in assessing whether a deportation involves such a trauma that it in itself constitutes a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, its physical and mental effects and the state of health of the person concerned are to be taken into account (see Eur. Court HR, Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 31, §§ 83-84, and the opinion of the Commission, p. 87, §§ 87-90).In so far as the applicant’s mental problems relate to his fear of what will happen to him upon return to Bosnia-Hercegovina or Croatia, the Court recalls its above finding that no substantial basis has been shown for this fear. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that the police authority in charge of the enforcement of the deportation order will take into account the applicant’s state of health when deciding how the deportation is to be carried out. In this connection, it is to be noted that, should the applicant be taken into compulsory psychiatric care due to his mental problems, the deportation could under no circumstances take place without the permission of the chief physician responsible for his care (see application no. 27249/95, decision of 14 September 1995, DR 83, p. 91). The Court notes further that the applicant has been discharged from the psychiatric clinic where he previously received treatment.In these circumstances, the Court does not find it established that the applicant’s deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of his present state of health.It follows that this part of the application is also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Michael O’Boyle Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-02-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4521', 'appno': '45920/99', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'SWE', 'extractedappno': '45920/99;14209/88;27249/95', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '341;350;193', 'doc_id': 'a9492e5a-0beb-4cdf-932e-ef7106d7bfea'}, page_content='to Croatia. The Board had regard to a guiding decision taken by the Swedish Government on 28 November 1996. In that decision the Government stated, inter alia, the following:(Translation)“As regards the situation in Croatia and the region, the ongoing peace process, based on a general agreement on peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina, has lead to stabilisation. The relations between Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia have improved. Croatia has been admitted into the Council of Europe. Acts of warfare have not occurred on Croatian territory since August 1995. The risk of further conflicts appears unlikely. The general situation'), -34.027252197265625), (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 13259, 'The Law': 'The respondent Government have in their submissions to the Court raised a number of objections to the admissibility of the application. The Court will examine the objections under the following headings:I. The scope of the application;II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç;III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practice.I. The scope of the applicationThe respondent Government maintain that the “invitation” of the applicant Government in respect of interrogation techniques in Turkey is not the object of the complaint and thus falls outside the scope of the application. The applicant Government dispute this.The Court recalls that under Article 33 of the Convention any High Contracting Party may refer to the Court any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party. The Court observes that the applicant Government complain that the ill-treatment of Mr Koç does not appear to be an isolated incident, but rather just one example of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey, inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention and invite the Court to examine whether this is in fact the case. The Court finds that the contents of the application and the written and oral submissions are sufficiently clear and precise for a judicial examination under the Convention also on this point. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application concerns not only the specific situation of Mr Koç but also, as an additional and separate complaint, the allegation of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey.II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç.The Court recalls Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which reads as follows:“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, embodied in the above provision, applies to State applications (Article 33) in the same way as it does to “individual” applications (Article 34), when the applicant State does no more than denounce a violation or violations allegedly suffered by individuals whose place is taken by the State (cf. e.g. the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series of no. 25, p. 64, §159). Accordingly, in order to examine the complaints made on behalf of Mr Koç, the Court must in principle first examine whether the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies has been complied with.The Court agrees with the respondent Government that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. This is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. This is, inter alia, the case where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance thereof by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (ibid.).In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is furthermore a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non‑exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant - in the specific case the applicant Government - to establish that the remedy advanced was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see e.g. the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, § 68).In the present case the Court recalls that the respondent Government maintain that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with, in particular since criminal proceedings are at present pending before the Court of Cassation where the allegations made by Mr Koç will be examined and, if necessary, redressed. The applicant Government maintain, however, that this remedy is inadequate and ineffective, in particular since the allegations concern an administrative practice of ill-treatment of persons in police custody.The Court finds that the question of whether the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies applies or has been satisfied in the present case raises issues which are so closely related to the question of the existence of an administrative practice that, to avoid prejudging the latter, both issues should be examined together. It recalls, however, that at the stage of admissibility, in inter-State cases, it is not the Court’s task to carry out a preliminary examination of the merits, since the provisions of Article 35 - empowering it to declare inadmissible petitions which it considers either incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or manifestly ill-founded - apply only to individual applications under Article 34. Consequently, any examination of the merits of the application must in such cases be reserved for the post-admissibility stage.Accordingly, the Court considers that the final determination of the issue concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç should be joined to the merits and reserved for later consideration.III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practiceThe Court recalls that, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant Government complain of an alleged practice of ill-treatment. They submit that persons in police custody have been tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. They have adduced evidence to show that, during the period covered by this application, torture or ill‑treatment are not merely isolated incidents or exceptions, but so widespread and applied in such a systematic manner as to constitute an administrative practice in the meaning of the case-law of the Court. The applicant Government maintain that the rule of the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application.While generally stating that the facts are not admitted, the respondent Government have not offered any counter-evidence or made comments on the material presented by the applicant Government.The Court recalls that in principle the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply where the applicant State complains of a practice as such, with the aim of preventing its continuation or recurrence (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 64, § 159). The Court notes that in respect of this part of the application, leaving aside the particular situation of Mr Koç as set out above, the applicant Government have not asked the Court to give a decision on any individual case and it follows therefore that the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application. In addition, the Court finds from the evidence submitted that the allegation made by the applicant Government is not wholly unsubstantiated or otherwise, as set out above, lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation in the sense of Article 33 of the Convention. The further examination, however, of all other questions regarding the existence and extent of such an administrative practice and its consistency with the provisions of the Convention relate to the merits and cannot, therefore, be considered by the Court at the stage of admissibility.Finally the Court notes that the applicant Government have requested the Court to examine the period from 1 January 1996 until today.The Court considers that an issue may arise as to whether it can examine a period which goes back further than six months from the date of introduction of the application. However, as the questions relating to the six-month rule in the present circumstances are also closely linked to the questions concerning the existence and extent of the alleged administrative practice, the answers thereto would again imply a preliminary examination of the merits of the case. The Court therefore reserves these questions for later consideration.It follows that the applicant Government’s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 1 and Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, by a majority,JOINS TO THE MERITS, the questions relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç and the six-month ruleandDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.Michael O’Boyle Elisabeth Palm Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-06-08 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4644', 'appno': '34382/97', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'TUR', 'extractedappno': '34382/97;1996/74', 'conclusion': 'Admissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;193;567;197;14;128;109;471', 'doc_id': '7165ed69-e979-4a0b-a836-dad06f91b6f2'}, page_content='changes that may take place in the evidence, and provided that the defendant is not convicted orarrested for another crime, he should be released promptly; and a letter to this effect should be sent to the Prosecution of the State Security Court; (For this item only Judge Captain Tanju Güvendiren has expressed his opposition.)4. for these reasons, and taking into consideration the letters to be written and for their replies, the case was adjourned until 19 September 1996, at 11:00.”As set out above Mr Koç returned to Denmark on 16 August 1996.

       "[(Document(metadata={'Word Count': 2525, 'The Law': '1. The applicant complains that the Hungarian authorities’ procedure concerning his request for asylum and his potential deportation amounted to a breach of Article 3 of the Convention.Article 3 of the Convention provides that no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.Article 34, so far as relevant, provides that the Court may receive applications from any person claiming to be the victim of a violation by one of the High Contracting Parties of the rights set forth in the Convention or the protocols thereto.The Government submit that on 25 January 1999 the Office ruled that, in pursuance of S. 32 § 1 of the 1993 Aliens Act, the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt. According to S. 25 of Government Decree no. 64/1994, the applicant should not in the future be deported from Hungarian territory as long as the relevant situation in his country of origin persists, i.e. the reasons prohibiting his expulsion cease to exist. For the duration of the asylum proceedings, he is authorised to reside in Hungary. A temporary residence permit will be issued to him, should he not be granted refugee status in the court proceedings. In these circumstances the Government are of the view that the applicant’s complaint has lost relevance.The applicant submits that the applicant’s forcible return to Egypt, as attempted by the Hungarian authorities notwithstanding that his court action was pending, could have resulted in his expulsion to Iraq and thus could have exposed him to a treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention. Furthermore, the absence of a thorough investigation into his statements in the asylum proceedings and, in particular, the fact that the Hungarian authorities did not prevent the Iraqi consul from interfering with their proceedings amounted to another violation of Article 3. Unless he will be granted asylum in the pending court proceedings, the issue of his subsistence in Hungary is not resolved, since the certificate to be issued under S. 25 of Government Decree no. 64/1994 would not guarantee him any legal status with a view to staying in Hungary.The Court observes that on 25 January 1999 the Office decided that the applicant could not be deported to Iraq or Egypt. In these circumstances, the Court considers that it is not called upon to examine the applicant’s complaints concerning his attempted return to Egypt or the alleged shortcomings of the asylum proceedings. Since the applicant is not exposed any more to the imminent danger of being expelled to a country where he might be subjected to a treatment in breach of Article 3, he can no longer claim to be a victim of a violation of his rights under that Article within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.2. The applicant also complains under Article 13 read in conjunction with Article 3 of the Convention that there was no effective remedy at his disposal to challenge the denial of a refugee status and his attempted forcible return to Egypt since the court action to challenge the lawfulness of the administrative proceedings had no suspensive effect.Article 13 of the Convention provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.The Court notes that in the decision of 22 December 1998 it was specified that an action to challenge the lawfulness of the asylum proceedings was of no suspensive effect concerning the applicant’s return to Cairo as ordered and, moreover, that subsequently the Hungarian authorities attempted to execute his return, notwithstanding the fact that his action had meanwhile been filed with the Budapest Regional Court. The question arises, therefore, whether - when introducing his application - the applicant had at his disposal a remedy before the national authorities concerning his deportation which could be considered effective within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention.However, as set out above in regard to his complaints under Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant is no longer exposed to the threat of imminent expulsion from Hungary. In the light of this development in the case, his pending court action for asylum can now be regarded as capable of redressing his claim. Consequently, this remedy cannot be held ineffective for the purposes of Article 13 of the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is likewise manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.3. Lastly, the applicant complains that his detention at the Communal Accommodation of the Budapest Border Guards Directorate amounted to a deprivation of liberty contrary to Article 5 §§ 1 and 4 in that it was not ordered in a manner satisfactorily prescribed by law and could not be appealed to a judicial body.Article 5 §§ 1 and 4, so far as relevant, provide:“1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law: ...f. the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition. …4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful.”Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, so far as relevant, provides that the Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law.The Government submit that the Communal Accommodation was lawfully designated as the applicant’s compulsory place of residence under S. 43 of the 1993 Aliens Act. Paragraph 5 of that Section provides that the judicial review of an order designating a compulsory place of residence can be requested from the courts. According to Ss. 39 to 42, such review may be requested at any time during detention. In the court proceedings the claimant must be heard in person and the court’s decisions is subject to appeal. Section 50 provides that the courts shall proceed speedily in these matters. Since, however, the applicant has not availed himself of this remedy, his complaints should be rejected for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.The applicant submits that the domestic legal provisions on the designation of a foreigner’s compulsory place of residence are not clear enough to meet the criteria of accessibility and precision. In the light of the non-suspensive effect of the request for the judicial review of the deportation order, the applicant could not have recourse to a remedy, effective for the purposes of Article 5 § 4, to challenge the lawfulness of the deprivation of his liberty. In any event, such a remedy could have been pursued only under the relevant rules of the Code of Civil Procedure: to achieve a judicial review of the impugned administrative decision, a proper action must have been brought in default of which the request might have been rejected without an examination on the merits. In a situation where legal assistance was hardly available, the relevant formal requirements rendered this remedy virtually inaccessible. Furthermore, due to the courts’ heavy workload, the proceedings in question may have lasted for months, contrary to the requirement of speediness under Article 5 § 4.The Court considers that it is not called upon to decide whether the applicant’s commitment to the Communal Accommodation amounted to a deprivation of liberty within the meaning of Article 5 of the Convention or whether it was ordered lawfully, since these complaints are in any event inadmissible for the reasons set out below.The Court recalls that the opportunity of preventing or putting right the violations alleged against them is in principle intended to be afforded to Contracting States by the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see the Cardot v. France judgment of 19 March 1991, Series A no. 200, p. 19, § 36). The Convention leaves to each Contracting State, in the first place, the task of securing the enjoyment of the rights and freedoms it enshrines (see the Eckle v. Germany judgment of 15 July 1982, Series A no. 51, pp. 30-31, § 66). Where doubts exist as to the effectiveness of a domestic remedy, that remedy must be tried (cf., e.g., No. 13669/88, Dec. 7.3.90, D. R. 65, p. 245).In the present case the Court observes that S. 43 § 5 of the 1993 Aliens Act provides that a judicial review of an administrative decision ordering a foreigner’s compulsory place of residence may be requested from the competent court. However, the applicant did not avail himself of this remedy. The Court finds that mere doubts as to the outcome or the length of the court proceedings in question did not exempt the applicant from having to exhaust the domestic remedy available to him.It follows that this part of the application must be rejected under Article 35 § 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Erik Fribergh Marc Fischbach Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-05-04 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4570', 'appno': '45163/99', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'HUN', 'extractedappno': '45163/99;13669/88', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '183;498;14;128;444;110;350;448', 'doc_id': 'd00be02f-afac-4867-a4c8-b7a49785e09d'}, page_content='is issued; or (c) this is necessary for the purposes of guaranteeing the execution of an expulsion, until the establishment of the conditions of expulsion; or (d) his return was ordered (see S. 25 above); or (e) his return or expulsion should take place, but he may not be returned or expelled in accordance with the prohibition under S. 32 § 1.The compulsory place of residence may also be designated at a communal accommodation, if the foreigner is not able to support himself, and no appropriate accommodation, financial means, income and inviting party or relatives obliged to'),\n",

       " (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 13259, 'The Law': 'The respondent Government have in their submissions to the Court raised a number of objections to the admissibility of the application. The Court will examine the objections under the following headings:I. The scope of the application;II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç;III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practice.I. The scope of the applicationThe respondent Government maintain that the “invitation” of the applicant Government in respect of interrogation techniques in Turkey is not the object of the complaint and thus falls outside the scope of the application. The applicant Government dispute this.The Court recalls that under Article 33 of the Convention any High Contracting Party may refer to the Court any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party. The Court observes that the applicant Government complain that the ill-treatment of Mr Koç does not appear to be an isolated incident, but rather just one example of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey, inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention and invite the Court to examine whether this is in fact the case. The Court finds that the contents of the application and the written and oral submissions are sufficiently clear and precise for a judicial examination under the Convention also on this point. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application concerns not only the specific situation of Mr Koç but also, as an additional and separate complaint, the allegation of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey.II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç.The Court recalls Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which reads as follows:“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, embodied in the above provision, applies to State applications (Article 33) in the same way as it does to “individual” applications (Article 34), when the applicant State does no more than denounce a violation or violations allegedly suffered by individuals whose place is taken by the State (cf. e.g. the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series of no. 25, p. 64, §159). Accordingly, in order to examine the complaints made on behalf of Mr Koç, the Court must in principle first examine whether the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies has been complied with.The Court agrees with the respondent Government that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. This is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. This is, inter alia, the case where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance thereof by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (ibid.).In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is furthermore a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non‑exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant - in the specific case the applicant Government - to establish that the remedy advanced was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see e.g. the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, § 68).In the present case the Court recalls that the respondent Government maintain that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with, in particular since criminal proceedings are at present pending before the Court of Cassation where the allegations made by Mr Koç will be examined and, if necessary, redressed. The applicant Government maintain, however, that this remedy is inadequate and ineffective, in particular since the allegations concern an administrative practice of ill-treatment of persons in police custody.The Court finds that the question of whether the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies applies or has been satisfied in the present case raises issues which are so closely related to the question of the existence of an administrative practice that, to avoid prejudging the latter, both issues should be examined together. It recalls, however, that at the stage of admissibility, in inter-State cases, it is not the Court’s task to carry out a preliminary examination of the merits, since the provisions of Article 35 - empowering it to declare inadmissible petitions which it considers either incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or manifestly ill-founded - apply only to individual applications under Article 34. Consequently, any examination of the merits of the application must in such cases be reserved for the post-admissibility stage.Accordingly, the Court considers that the final determination of the issue concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç should be joined to the merits and reserved for later consideration.III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practiceThe Court recalls that, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant Government complain of an alleged practice of ill-treatment. They submit that persons in police custody have been tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. They have adduced evidence to show that, during the period covered by this application, torture or ill‑treatment are not merely isolated incidents or exceptions, but so widespread and applied in such a systematic manner as to constitute an administrative practice in the meaning of the case-law of the Court. The applicant Government maintain that the rule of the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application.While generally stating that the facts are not admitted, the respondent Government have not offered any counter-evidence or made comments on the material presented by the applicant Government.The Court recalls that in principle the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply where the applicant State complains of a practice as such, with the aim of preventing its continuation or recurrence (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 64, § 159). The Court notes that in respect of this part of the application, leaving aside the particular situation of Mr Koç as set out above, the applicant Government have not asked the Court to give a decision on any individual case and it follows therefore that the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application. In addition, the Court finds from the evidence submitted that the allegation made by the applicant Government is not wholly unsubstantiated or otherwise, as set out above, lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation in the sense of Article 33 of the Convention. The further examination, however, of all other questions regarding the existence and extent of such an administrative practice and its consistency with the provisions of the Convention relate to the merits and cannot, therefore, be considered by the Court at the stage of admissibility.Finally the Court notes that the applicant Government have requested the Court to examine the period from 1 January 1996 until today.The Court considers that an issue may arise as to whether it can examine a period which goes back further than six months from the date of introduction of the application. However, as the questions relating to the six-month rule in the present circumstances are also closely linked to the questions concerning the existence and extent of the alleged administrative practice, the answers thereto would again imply a preliminary examination of the merits of the case. The Court therefore reserves these questions for later consideration.It follows that the applicant Government’s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 1 and Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, by a majority,JOINS TO THE MERITS, the questions relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç and the six-month ruleandDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.Michael O’Boyle Elisabeth Palm Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-06-08 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4644', 'appno': '34382/97', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'TUR', 'extractedappno': '34382/97;1996/74', 'conclusion': 'Admissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;193;567;197;14;128;109;471', 'doc_id': '7165ed69-e979-4a0b-a836-dad06f91b6f2'}, page_content='legal association;2. as the defendant Kemal Koç has stated that he took part in the Kurdish National Assembly in Germany in 1992 as a delegate, it should be determined whether this is true or not, the information and documents, if available, particularly from the point of view of the defendant’s participation at the meeting, should be requested from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs through the Ministry of Justice;3. taking into consideration the nature of the crime of which the defendant Kemal Koç is accused and considering the possibility of the changes that may take place in the evidence, and provided'),\n",

       " (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 6697, 'The Law': 'The applicants complain that the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces of the United Kingdom violated their rights under Articles 3, 5, 8 and 10, alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention. They also consider that they did not have an effective remedy within the meaning of Article 13 in respect of the alleged violations of Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14 of the Convention1. Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the ConventionThe first applicant complains about being detained by the armed forces authorities on 15 June 1994 and thereafter. The second applicant complains about being detained on 17 May 1994, during his interviews under caution on 25 and 26 May 1994 and thereafter. Both invoke Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 in these respects. Article 5 of the Convention guarantees the right to liberty and security of person and Article 14 ensures freedom from discrimination in the securement of Convention rights (see p. 18 below).However, the Court notes that applicants were definitively discharged from the air force on 16 November and 16 December 1994, respectively and that the domestic proceedings pursued by them did not relate to any detention matters. Accordingly, even assuming that the applicants could demonstrate a form of detention within the meaning of Article 5 during and/or after the investigation of their homosexuality by the armed forces authorities, and even if the six-month time-limit set down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention began to run for both applicants from the date of their discharge from the armed forces, their respective applications have been introduced (on 9 and 6 September 1996, respectively) outside of this time-limit.In such circumstances, their complaints as regards alleged periods of detention prior to their discharge from the armed forces under Articles 5 and 14 of the Convention are inadmissible pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.2. Article 3 of the ConventionThe applicants complain that the policy excluding homosexuals from the armed forces and the consequent investigations and discharges amounted to degrading treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. In addition, they submit that their discriminatory treatment, based on crude stereotyping and prejudice, denied and caused affront to their individuality and dignity (Nos. 4403/70 et subs, East African Asians v. the United Kingdom, Comm. Report 14.12.73, D.R. 78-A) and, as such, amounted to treatment contrary to Article 3. This Article reads, insofar as relevant, as follows:\"No one shall be subjected to ... degrading treatment or punishment.\"The Government submit that, given the serious and reasonable basis and aim of the policy (maintaining the fighting power and effectiveness of the armed forces) and in the absence of any intention to degrade or humiliate, the policy cannot be categorised as degrading. They would distinguish the above-cited East African Asians case since that case dealt with racial discrimination. They also defend the investigation procedure arguing that the aim is not to humiliate persons but to deal with cases as quickly and as discreetly as possible. The applicants chose to answer questions having been informed of their right not to so answer. Indeed the second applicant exercised for a period of time his rights not to answer and to have a lawyer present. Given the matter at issue, intimate questions are inevitable in the investigation process and the Government clarify that no reference is made in the discharge certificate to sexual orientation.In response, the applicants point out that it is sufficient if the victim is “humiliated in his own eyes” (Tyer v. United Kingdom judgment of 25 April 1978, Series A no. 26, p. 16, § 32). As to the East African Asians case, the distinction made by the Government is a technical one - they were labelled and categorised, which process debases and denigrates an individual’s existence and character. Moreover, treatment contrary to Article 3 cannot ever have a justification. As to the suggestion that the applicants could have chosen not to participate in the interviews, they submit that their complaint relates to the entire investigation and dismissal process, the caution given was in fact the standard caution given to a criminal suspect, the fact that questions were put was hurtful and degrading, and the absence of a legal obligation to answer the questions in no way mitigated that effect. In any event, the questions extended significantly beyond an inquiry into sexual orientation - the questioning continued after both applicants admitted their sexual orientation and included allegations that were offensive and unfounded.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 3 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.3. Article 8 of the ConventionThe applicants also complain under Article 8 of the Convention about the investigation and inquiries made into their sexual orientation and about their subsequent discharge from the armed forces pursuant to the absolute policy against those of homosexual orientation in the armed forces. Article 8, insofar as relevant, read as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private ... life, ... .2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety ..., for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.”The Government accept that neither the applicants’ service records nor their conduct would give any grounds for complaint and that there is no evidence that, prior to the discovery of their sexual orientation, such orientation adversely affected the performance by them or by their colleagues of their duties. Nor is it contended by the Government that homosexuals are less physically capable, brave, dependable or skilled than heterosexuals. The Government also accept that there has been an interference with the applicants’ private lives and considers that the discharges were ‘in accordance with the law’.However, the Government underline the wide margin of appreciation which is properly open to a State in this context (Leander v. Sweden judgment of 26 March 1987, Series A no. 116, p. 25, § 59) by reference to four matters. In the first place, they refer to the intense debate in recent years in the United Kingdom on the subject. Secondly, given the national security dimension and the special nature of life and duties in the armed forces, the complaints are made in a special armed forces’ context to which different and more stricter rules can apply (Engel v. the Netherlands judgment of 8 June 1976, Series A No. 22, , p. 24, § 57 and Kalaç v. Turkey judgment of 23 June 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-IV, no. 41, p. 1209, § 28). Thirdly, the Government point out that the applicants are requesting the Court to interfere in a field which risks damaging the operational efficacy of the armed forces. Finally, it is argued that the diverse legal and practical positions in other countries as well as the comparatively recent legal changes in many of those countries indicate that the treatment of this controversial issue is still in a transitional period.The Government consider that the observations and conclusions in the HPAT Report of February 1996 demonstrate that the present policy is justifiable. The view that changing the policy at this time would involve a clear and unacceptable risk to fighting power and, consequently, to the effectiveness of the armed forces is, according to the Government, a reasonable and legitimate conclusion on a sensitive and controversial question. Further, it is a conclusion which is not undermined by the lack of a similar ban in other disciplined but civilian contexts in the United Kingdom or by the fact that certain other countries have changed their laws to admit homosexuals into their armed forces.The Government also deal in their observations with certain of the applicants’ submissions to the domestic courts. The applicants had claimed that there was no evidence that their or others’ homosexual orientation caused the type of problems anticipated by the HPAT. The Government point out that the discharge of all persons of established homosexual orientation ‘before such damage results’ means that concrete evidence establishing the risks identified by the HPAT may not be available. In any event, the Government note that the risks envisaged “would result from the general relaxation of the policy, rather than its modification in any particular instance”. The applicants had also argued in favour of a conduct based code. The Government note that this option was rejected by the HPAT on the basis that any such code would not avoid the real risk to the effectiveness of the armed forces because the risk was not dependent on homosexual conduct but on the “presence in the armed forces of those of known or strongly suspected homosexual orientation”.Finally, the Government explain that homosexuality will be investigated in order to ensure that personnel are not attempting to obtain early discharge on the basis of false representations of homosexuality. An investigation usually implies questioning the individual and seeking corroborative evidence and, given the nature of the subject matter, will necessarily cover intimate and personal issues. The Government also defend the conduct of the interviews pointing out that both applicants were informed at the outset that they did not have to say anything unless they wished to do so but they both, nevertheless, chose to co-operate.Accordingly, the Government submit that the interferences with the applicants’ private lives by the investigations and discharges were proportionate. In such circumstances, the Government argue that the applicants’ complaints are manifestly ill-founded, within the meaning of Article 35 § 3, or, in the alternative, do not give rise to a violation of the Convention.The applicants submit that both their investigation and discharge from the armed forces constituted serious interferences with their private lives for which the armed forces have not offered any objective or “particularly serious reasons” by way of justification (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. p. 21, § 52 and Vogt v. Germany judgment of 26 September 1995, Series A no. 323, pp. 22-23, §§ 42-44). They refer, inter alia, to their good service records and to the lack of any allegations of inappropriate conduct contrasted with the absolute nature of the policy against homosexuals (the only matter for which an absolute policy of discharge is pursued). They also contrast the position in foreign armed forces and in other civilian but disciplined forces. They note the contents of the HPAT Report observing that the main argument contained therein in favour of the policy (the maintenance of morale and fighting power) amounts to pandering to the prejudice of others against those of homosexual orientation. Indeed they note that the same argument could be used to exclude women, ethnic minorities and those of different religions.The applicants deal in some detail in their observations with the HPAT assessment and Report submitting that both are fundamentally flawed and unsustainable.In the first place, the applicants contend that the HPAT assessment is not objective and was designed to defend the continuation of the ban. Secondly, the methodology adopted by the HPAT is also suspect - the basic hypothesis upon which the assessment was based demonstrated prejudice and traditional stereo-typing of homosexual behaviour and the assessment set out to prove this flawed hypothesis. The phrasing of the questions in the questionnaire reinforced the “party line”, validated popular prejudice and induced fear in the respondents about a change in the policy. There were no guarantees of confidentiality as regards the responses and there was, in any event, a minimal response from service personnel. Thirdly, the conclusions drawn by the HPAT in its Report do not withstand scrutiny. The results are based entirely on group prejudice that does not reflect the reality of how individuals behave towards each other in practice. The HPAT ignored the considerable importance of information it had obtained from foreign armed forces and other British civilian disciplined forces. The HPAT also failed to take into account certain important factors including the responsibility of the armed forces to combat discrimination, the continued service of individuals of homosexual orientation in the armed forces, the experience of those who admitted their homosexuality, the reduction of the risk of blackmail, the cost implications of dismissing trained personnel, the fact that homosexuals served in both World Wars without effecting combat effectiveness and the views of the women in the armed forces who were largely in favour of lifting the ban. Moreover, certain factors were erroneously taken into account including the increased costs associated with combating discrimination and the \"image” of the services.As to Article 8 of the Convention specifically, the applicants argue, inter alia, that the Government must show that the ‘legitimate aim’ is achieved, at least to some extent, by the policy pursued. Since the reduction in fighting power cannot be sustained, then neither can the aim of national security. Insofar as the policy is aimed at the prevention of disorder arising from fears of harassment of homosexuals, then this cannot be accepted as a ‘legitimate’ aim, allowing as it does the exclusion of a minority group based on perceived fears of their harassment.As to the proportionality of the interferences, the applicants adopt the submissions in this respect of Mr Lustig-Prean (No. 31417/96, Dec. 23.2.99, as yet unpublished) before the Court adding that, such are the democratic ideals and the notion of respect and protection of individual rights upon which the Convention is founded, the prejudice of a majority can never constitute a justification for the infringement of minority rights. Moreover, the applicants add that, since the Government argue that it is the knowledge of homosexuality which would undermine morale and fighting power, had there been no investigation by the authorities, there would have been no such knowledge.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 8 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.4. Article 10 of the ConventionThe applicants further complain under Article 10 of the Convention about the limitation imposed by the policy on their right to give expression to their sexual identity. Article 10, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority ... .2. The exercise of these freedoms, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, ... for the prevention of disorder ... .”The Government contend that freedom of expression is not an issue in these cases. The applicants were free to express information and ideas and to inform others of their sexual orientation. Their discharge was not a result of any expression of information or ideas - rather it was a consequence of the fact of their homosexuality which, until they came under investigation, they had chosen to conceal. In any event, any interference with the applicants’ freedom of expression was justified for the same reasons advanced by the Government in the context of Article 8 and, accordingly, no separate issue arises under Article 10.The applicants argue that the right to give expression to one’s sexuality encapsulates opinions, ideas and information essential to an individual and their identity. The policy forced the applicants to live secret lives denying them the simple opportunity to communicate openly and freely their own sexual identity which, in turn, had a chilling effect on them and was a powerful inhibiting factor in their right to express themselves. For the reasons outlined in the context of Article 8, the applicants submit that the interference with their right to freedom of expression did not have a legitimate aim and/or was not necessary and/or was not proportionate.In their observations, the applicants refer to the Government’s submission about their freedom to express their homosexuality as ‘hardly credible’. If the applicants had done so they would have been immediately investigated and dismissed and, in any event, that is what effectively happened. The applicants note that the Government rely, in this context, on the justification offered for the interferences with their private lives and that they make no attempt to provide justification for what is an extreme limitation on expression or for the substantial consequences suffered by the applicants for expressing their homosexuality.The applicants would add to their submissions under Article 8 § 2 that the expression of one’s homosexual orientation is a necessary and essential part of one’s sense of being, one’s existence as an individual and one’s self-fulfilment. Exceptions to the right of freedom of expression must be narrowly interpreted. Given the fact that expression which might shock, offend or disturb is protected, the mere fact that members of the armed forces would, as the Government submit, be upset by the presence of known homosexuals is insufficient justification for an interference under Article 10. The case of Kalaç v. Turkey (loc. cit) can be distinguished - the applicant in that case was able to express and practice his religious opinions and beliefs and he was discharged, not for his religious beliefs and opinions, but rather as a result of his conduct, the latter of which is not an issue in the present cases.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 10 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.5. Article 14 in conjunction with Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the ConventionThe applicants also invoke Article 14 of the Convention in conjunction with Articles 3, 8 and 10 of the Convention. Article 14, insofar as relevant, reads as follows:“ The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, ... political or other opinion, ... or other status.”The Government submit that the complaint under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 3 does not give rise to any separate issue. They also consider that there is no separate issue under Article 14 in conjunction with Article 8 (Dudgeon v. the United Kingdom judgment of 22 October 1981, Series A no. 45, pp. 25-26. §§ 64-70) or, in the alternative, that any difference in treatment is justified for the same reasons submitted in the context of Article 8 § 2.The applicants consider that they have been treated differently in relation to these Convention rights on the basis of “sex” (which should be interpreted to include sexual orientation) and/or “other status”. They submit that, even if the policy against homosexuals in the armed forces pursued a legitimate aim (which they dispute), it was not proportionate to aim sought to be realised.The applicants observe that the Government have not offered any added reasons to justify the difference in treatment. However, the case-law shows that the State must show “very weighty reasons” in order to establish justification for a difference in treatment (Abudulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, pp. 37-38, § 78 and Karlheinz Schmidt v. Germany judgment of 18 July 1994, Series A no. 291-B, p. 32, § 34) and that a narrow margin of appreciation applies in considering whether sufficient justification has been provided.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 14 of the Convention which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.6. Article 13 of the ConventionFinally, the applicants complain that the judicial review proceedings did not constitute an effective remedy, within the meaning of Article 13 of the Convention, for the alleged violations of Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14. Article 13 reads, insofar as relevant, as follows:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in this Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority ... .”The Government submit, in the first place, that there is no arguable claim in relation to any of the applicants’ complaints. In any event, they argue, referring to the Vilvarajah case, that judicial review does provide an effective remedy (Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215). In particular, the substance of the Convention arguments could be, and was, advanced before the domestic courts and the same arguments relied on by the applicants before the Court were relied on by them before the domestic courts. They consider that any difference between the judicial review test and the margin of appreciation was not central to the issues in these cases and the essential reasoning of the Court of Appeal mirrors that which underpins the Convention margin of appreciation - both the domestic courts and the Convention organs retain a supervisory role to ensure that the State does not abuse its powers or exceed its margin of appreciation.The applicants submit that the test applied in the judicial review proceedings is too limited to provide an effective remedy. It is much wider than the margin of appreciation accorded to States and cannot take account of the requirements of objective justification and proportionality of interferences with individual rights.The applicants also contend that the Government’s arguments are not sustainable. Their complaints are clearly arguable. Moreover, the Court of Appeal expressly rejected its jurisdiction to consider arguments under Article 8 of the Convention including issues such as ‘pressing social need’ and proportionality. Moreover, it was clear that the large difference between the margin of appreciation and the “high” standard of irrationality which had to be applied by the Court of Appeal was the main reason why that court was obliged to dismiss the judicial review applications despite having considered the applicants’ submissions persuasive.In view of the submissions of the parties, the Court considers that the applications raise complex and serious issues under Article 13, in connection with Articles 3, 8, 10 and 14 of the Convention, which require determination on the merits. It follows that this complaint cannot be dismissed as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been established.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES INADMISSIBLE the applicants’ complaints under Article 5 alone and in conjunction with Article 14 of the Convention;DECLARES ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the cases, the remainder of the applications.S.

       " (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 1384, 'The Law': '1. The applicant complains that his deportation to Croatia would involve a violation of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention, which provision reads as follows:“Collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited.”The Court finds that collective expulsion is to be understood as any measure compelling aliens, as a group, to leave a country, except where such a measure is taken on the basis of a reasonable and objective examination of the particular case of each individual alien of the group. Moreover, the fact that a number of aliens receive similar decisions does not lead to the conclusion that there is a collective expulsion when each person concerned has been given the opportunity to put arguments against his expulsion to the competent authorities on an individual basis (see application no. 14209/88, decision of 16 December 1988, DR 59, p. 274).In the present case, the Court notes that the Swedish Government issued guidelines for the assessment of asylum applications submitted by persons holding both Bosnian and Croatian citizenship. Furthermore, in examining the applicant’s case, the National Immigration Board and the Aliens Appeals Board had regard to the general situation for persons with the applicant’s background in Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia.However, the applicant submitted individual applications to the immigration authorities and was able to present any arguments he wished to make against his possible deportation to the respective countries. The authorities took into account not only the general situation in the countries but also the applicant’s statements concerning his own background and the risks allegedly facing him upon return. In rejecting his applications, the authorities issued individual decisions concerning the applicant’s situation.In these circumstances, the Court considers that the applicant’s possible deportation does not reveal any appearance of a collective expulsion within the meaning of Article 4 of Protocol No. 4 to the Convention.It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.2. The Court finds that the present application should be examined also under Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”The Court recalls that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens. However, an expulsion decision may give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention, and hence engage the responsibility of the State, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country to which he or she is to be expelled (see, among other authorities,the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no.215, p. 34, §§ 102-103). A mere possibility of ill-treatment is not in itself sufficient (ibid., p. 37, § 111).In the present case, the Court recalls that the Swedish immigration authorities have ordered the applicant’s deportation to Bosnia-Hercegovina or Croatia. Apparently, the applicant is an ethnic Croat from Bosnia-Hercegovina. Furthermore, the applicant holds double citizenship. Having regard to the applicant’s statements and the conclusions drawn by the Swedish Government and the UNHCR the Court cannot find that he will be subjected to ill-treatment if returned to his home district in Bosnia-Hercegovina or to Croatia. In this connection, the Court finds that even if the applicant were to serve the five-year prison sentence for desertion he has allegedly received, this does not amount to ill-treatment falling under Article 3 of the Convention. Thus, the Court considers that there are not substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 if returned to either of the countries in question.However, without making a special reference in his complaint, the applicant has submitted a medical certificate showing that he is suffering from a post-traumatic stress syndrome and that there is a considerable risk of his attempting to commit suicide should he be deported from Sweden. In this connection, the Court notes that, in assessing whether a deportation involves such a trauma that it in itself constitutes a breach of Article 3 of the Convention, its physical and mental effects and the state of health of the person concerned are to be taken into account (see Eur. Court HR, Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 31, §§ 83-84, and the opinion of the Commission, p. 87, §§ 87-90).In so far as the applicant’s mental problems relate to his fear of what will happen to him upon return to Bosnia-Hercegovina or Croatia, the Court recalls its above finding that no substantial basis has been shown for this fear. Moreover, the Court is satisfied that the police authority in charge of the enforcement of the deportation order will take into account the applicant’s state of health when deciding how the deportation is to be carried out. In this connection, it is to be noted that, should the applicant be taken into compulsory psychiatric care due to his mental problems, the deportation could under no circumstances take place without the permission of the chief physician responsible for his care (see application no. 27249/95, decision of 14 September 1995, DR 83, p. 91). The Court notes further that the applicant has been discharged from the psychiatric clinic where he previously received treatment.In these circumstances, the Court does not find it established that the applicant’s deportation would amount to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of his present state of health.It follows that this part of the application is also manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,DECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Michael O’Boyle Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-02-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4521', 'appno': '45920/99', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'SWE', 'extractedappno': '45920/99;14209/88;27249/95', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '341;350;193', 'doc_id': 'a9492e5a-0beb-4cdf-932e-ef7106d7bfea'}, page_content='to Croatia.

       " (Document(metadata={'Word Count': 13259, 'The Law': 'The respondent Government have in their submissions to the Court raised a number of objections to the admissibility of the application. The Court will examine the objections under the following headings:I. The scope of the application;II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç;III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practice.I. The scope of the applicationThe respondent Government maintain that the “invitation” of the applicant Government in respect of interrogation techniques in Turkey is not the object of the complaint and thus falls outside the scope of the application. The applicant Government dispute this.The Court recalls that under Article 33 of the Convention any High Contracting Party may refer to the Court any alleged breach of the provisions of the Convention and the Protocols thereto by another High Contracting Party. The Court observes that the applicant Government complain that the ill-treatment of Mr Koç does not appear to be an isolated incident, but rather just one example of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey, inconsistent with Article 3 of the Convention and invite the Court to examine whether this is in fact the case. The Court finds that the contents of the application and the written and oral submissions are sufficiently clear and precise for a judicial examination under the Convention also on this point. Accordingly, the Court considers that the application concerns not only the specific situation of Mr Koç but also, as an additional and separate complaint, the allegation of a widespread unacceptable practice in Turkey.II. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in the case of Mr Kemal Koç.The Court recalls Article 35 § 1 of the Convention which reads as follows:“The Court may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law, and within a period of six months from the date on which the final decision was taken.”The rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, embodied in the above provision, applies to State applications (Article 33) in the same way as it does to “individual” applications (Article 34), when the applicant State does no more than denounce a violation or violations allegedly suffered by individuals whose place is taken by the State (cf. e.g. the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment of 18 January 1978, Series of no. 25, p. 64, §159). Accordingly, in order to examine the complaints made on behalf of Mr Koç, the Court must in principle first examine whether the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies has been complied with.The Court agrees with the respondent Government that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies obliges those seeking to bring their case against the State before an international judicial organ to use first the remedies provided by the national legal system. This is an important aspect of the principle that the machinery of protection established by the Convention is subsidiary to the national systems safeguarding human rights. However, there is no obligation to have recourse to remedies which are inadequate or ineffective. This is, inter alia, the case where an administrative practice consisting of a repetition of acts incompatible with the Convention and official tolerance thereof by the State authorities has been shown to exist, and is of such a nature as to make proceedings futile or ineffective (ibid.).In the area of the exhaustion of domestic remedies there is furthermore a distribution of the burden of proof. It is incumbent on the respondent Government claiming non‑exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. However, once this burden of proof has been satisfied it falls to the applicant - in the specific case the applicant Government - to establish that the remedy advanced was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case (see e.g. the Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV, p. 1211, § 68).In the present case the Court recalls that the respondent Government maintain that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies has not been complied with, in particular since criminal proceedings are at present pending before the Court of Cassation where the allegations made by Mr Koç will be examined and, if necessary, redressed. The applicant Government maintain, however, that this remedy is inadequate and ineffective, in particular since the allegations concern an administrative practice of ill-treatment of persons in police custody.The Court finds that the question of whether the requirement of the exhaustion of domestic remedies applies or has been satisfied in the present case raises issues which are so closely related to the question of the existence of an administrative practice that, to avoid prejudging the latter, both issues should be examined together. It recalls, however, that at the stage of admissibility, in inter-State cases, it is not the Court’s task to carry out a preliminary examination of the merits, since the provisions of Article 35 - empowering it to declare inadmissible petitions which it considers either incompatible with the provisions of the Convention or manifestly ill-founded - apply only to individual applications under Article 34. Consequently, any examination of the merits of the application must in such cases be reserved for the post-admissibility stage.Accordingly, the Court considers that the final determination of the issue concerning the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç should be joined to the merits and reserved for later consideration.III. Compliance with Article 35 § 1 of the Convention in respect of the issue of an administrative practiceThe Court recalls that, invoking Article 3 of the Convention, the applicant Government complain of an alleged practice of ill-treatment. They submit that persons in police custody have been tortured or subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. They have adduced evidence to show that, during the period covered by this application, torture or ill‑treatment are not merely isolated incidents or exceptions, but so widespread and applied in such a systematic manner as to constitute an administrative practice in the meaning of the case-law of the Court. The applicant Government maintain that the rule of the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application.While generally stating that the facts are not admitted, the respondent Government have not offered any counter-evidence or made comments on the material presented by the applicant Government.The Court recalls that in principle the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply where the applicant State complains of a practice as such, with the aim of preventing its continuation or recurrence (see the Ireland v. the United Kingdom judgment cited above, p. 64, § 159). The Court notes that in respect of this part of the application, leaving aside the particular situation of Mr Koç as set out above, the applicant Government have not asked the Court to give a decision on any individual case and it follows therefore that the rule as to the exhaustion of domestic remedies does not apply to this part of the application. In addition, the Court finds from the evidence submitted that the allegation made by the applicant Government is not wholly unsubstantiated or otherwise, as set out above, lacking the requirements of a genuine allegation in the sense of Article 33 of the Convention. The further examination, however, of all other questions regarding the existence and extent of such an administrative practice and its consistency with the provisions of the Convention relate to the merits and cannot, therefore, be considered by the Court at the stage of admissibility.Finally the Court notes that the applicant Government have requested the Court to examine the period from 1 January 1996 until today.The Court considers that an issue may arise as to whether it can examine a period which goes back further than six months from the date of introduction of the application. However, as the questions relating to the six-month rule in the present circumstances are also closely linked to the questions concerning the existence and extent of the alleged administrative practice, the answers thereto would again imply a preliminary examination of the merits of the case. The Court therefore reserves these questions for later consideration.It follows that the applicant Government’s complaints under Article 3 of the Convention cannot be declared inadmissible under Article 35 § 1 and Article 35 § 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, by a majority,JOINS TO THE MERITS, the questions relating to the exhaustion of domestic remedies in respect of Mr Koç and the six-month ruleandDECLARES THE APPLICATION ADMISSIBLE, without prejudging the merits of the case.Michael O’Boyle Elisabeth Palm Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-06-08 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4644', 'appno': '34382/97', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'TUR', 'extractedappno': '34382/97;1996/74', 'conclusion': 'Admissible', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;193;567;197;14;128;109;471', 'doc_id': '7165ed69-e979-4a0b-a836-dad06f91b6f2'}, page_content='changes that may take place in the evidence, and provided that the defendant is not convicted orarrested for another crime, he should be released promptly; and a letter to this effect should be sent to the Prosecution of the State Security Court; (For this item only Judge Captain Tanju Güvendiren has expressed his opposition.)4. for these reasons, and taking into consideration the letters to be written and for their replies, the case was adjourned until 19 September 1996, at 11:00.”As set out above Mr Koç returned to Denmark on 16 August 1996.

ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION77. The applicants contended that the police operation at their home had subjected them to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, which provides:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”78. The applicants complained in particular that the manner in which the police operation had been conducted – before daybreak, by masked and heavily armed police officers who had forced their way in and pointed their weapons at them and had handcuffed Mr Gutsanov while forcing him to kneel down – had subjected them to a severe psychological ordeal amounting to degrading treatment.79. In their written observations of 6 January 2012, the applicants complained of the lack of a criminal investigation into their alleged ill‑treatment during the police operation of 31 March 2010.A. Admissibility1. Complaint concerning the police operation of 31 March 2010(a) The Government’s observations80. The Government submitted that this complaint should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and failure to comply with the six‑month time-limit, and because it was premature and the applicants did not have victim status.81. They observed firstly that the criminal investigation against Mr Gutsanov was still pending, with the result that the complaint under Article 3 was premature.82. In the Government’s view, the applicants had not raised their complaint alleging degrading treatment before the competent authorities. Furthermore, they had not lodged an action for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. They had therefore omitted to exhaust the remedies that were normally available and effective under domestic law.83. The Government went on to observe that, in an order of 7 April 2010, the Varna regional public prosecutor’s office had decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers who had entered the applicants’ home. The prosecuting authorities had noted, inter alia, that the police officers’ actions had not constituted any criminal offence. They further argued that the actions in question had in no sense been intended to undermine the applicants’ dignity or cause them any psychological harm; accordingly, they did not amount to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. In the Government’s view, the applicants could not therefore claim to be victims of a violation of their rights under that Article.(b) The applicants’ observations84. The applicants did not dispute the fact that they had not lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had entered their home on 31 March 2010. However, they argued that such a remedy would be manifestly ineffective for two reasons in particular. Firstly, no provision of Bulgarian criminal law made it a punishable offence to inflict degrading treatment on others stemming from psychological pressure. Secondly, as the Court had found in a series of cases concerning operations by special officers of the national police force, the authorities’ systematic refusal to reveal the identity of the officers concerned would make any criminal investigation concerning them ineffective.85. The decision not to prosecute issued by the regional public prosecutor’s office in the present case merely confirmed that a criminal complaint would have been ineffective. The public prosecutor had taken the decision not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers shortly after the file had been opened, on the sole basis of two reports by police officers and without having taken statements from any other witnesses or gathered other evidence. The applicants had not been informed of that decision and had been deprived of any opportunity of being involved in the investigation.86. As to a possible action for damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act, the applicants maintained that this could likewise not be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in their case. According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, section 1 of the Act, under the terms of which the State could be held liable for damage caused as a result of administrative action, was not applicable to action taken by police officers to enforce investigative measures in the context of criminal proceedings, which formed part of the judicial process rather than the performance of administrative duties. Furthermore, in a binding interpretative judgment delivered in 2005, the Supreme Court of Cassation had made clear that where administrative bodies including the police were implementing measures ordered by the judicial authorities, an action for damages against the State could be brought only against the latter and on the basis of section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. However, section 2 provided for compensation in only a limited number of situations. The only one that could possibly apply in the present case was Mr Gutsanov’s acquittal or the subsequent discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him. However, it would be difficult for the applicants to prove their allegations given that all the witnesses to the events were police officers who had taken part in the operation of 31 March 2010.(c) The Court’s assessment87. The Court observes at the outset that the Government raised several objections of inadmissibility in relation to the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of the parties’ submissions, it considers that the issues of compliance with the six-month time-limit and the allegedly premature nature of the application are closely linked to the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government. It therefore considers it appropriate first of all to determine whether the applicants in the present case complied with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies.(i) Objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies88. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to have exhausted the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among many other authorities, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 81, ECHR 2000‑VII, and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000‑VII).89. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once that has been demonstrated, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑IV).90. According to the Court’s established case-law, the remedy normally available in Bulgarian law in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment allegedly caused by police officers is a complaint to the prosecuting authorities (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 86, Reports 1998‑VIII; Osman and Osman v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 43233/98, 6 May 2004; and Kemerov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004). The applicants in the present case did not lodge such a complaint with the public prosecutor against the police officers who entered their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They contended in that regard that a complaint to the prosecuting authorities could not be regarded as an effective remedy in their case, in view of the nature of the ill-treatment to which they had been subjected and the deficiency of the domestic criminal-law provisions (see paragraph 84 above).91. The Court observes that in its judgment in Hristovi v. Bulgaria (no. 42697/05, § 95, 11 October 2011), it noted with concern the treatment accorded in Bulgarian criminal law to acts causing psychological suffering. It noted in particular that, with the exception of the very specific case of death threats, the Bulgarian Criminal Code did not provide for the criminalisation of acts by police officers giving rise to this kind of suffering, resulting, for example, from an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. Hence, unless a complainant alleged that he or she had sustained physical injury at the hands of the police, the authorities could not be required to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the acts complained of. The Court noted that this deficiency in the criminal law allowed those responsible for inflicting psychological trauma to escape criminal accountability for their actions.92. The applicants in the present case complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of the police operation carried out at their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They did not claim to have been physically assaulted by the police officers. It therefore appears that if they had lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers in question, the prosecuting authorities would have inevitably refused to institute criminal proceedings because of the same legal deficiency observed by the Court in Hristovi (cited above). It follows that the criminal-law remedy that was normally available and effective in cases of physical violence inflicted by the police was bound from the outset to fail in the particular circumstances complained of by the applicants. The Court cannot therefore criticise them for not having lodged a complaint with the prosecuting authorities against the officers involved in the police operation.93. The Court further observes that in its judgment in Mirosław Garlicki v. Poland (no. 36921/07, § 77, 14 June 2011), it acknowledged that the civil claim for compensation provided for by Polish law in cases of violations of personal rights such as the right to health, liberty, honour and human dignity constituted appropriate redress in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, in a case in which the applicant complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of his arrest by masked officers, which had taken place in front of a large number of people and had subsequently received extensive media coverage. It observes that the applicants in the present case also complained of the psychological effects of the police operation targeting them. The Government contended that the applicants could have lodged a claim for compensation under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 82 above). However, the Court considers that, in contrast to the case of Mirosław Garlicki (cited above, §§ 77 and 78), where the applicant had available to him several effective domestic remedies, any action for compensation lodged by the four applicants under section 1 or 2 of the above-mentioned Bulgarian Act would have had no prospect of success, for the reasons outlined below.94. The Court points out in this regard that section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act allows individuals to bring proceedings in tort against the State on account of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions of State authorities or officials in the performance of their administrative duties. According to the settled case-law of the highest courts in Bulgaria, acts performed by the investigating and prosecuting authorities in the context of criminal proceedings do not form part of their administrative duties and thus do not come within the ambit of section 1 of the above-mentioned Act (see paragraph 67 above and Iliya Stefanov, cited above, § 28). The Court observes that the police operation at the applicants’ home was carried out in the context of criminal proceedings and was aimed at arresting Mr Gutsanov and searching his home for evidence. Hence, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the operation formed part of the investigative measures taken in the course of those proceedings and did not engage the State’s liability in tort under section 1 of the above-mentioned Act.95. As regards the applicability of section 2 of the same Act, the Court observes that the only situations that might have been applicable in the circumstances of the case were a finding that Mr Gutsanov’s detention was unlawful and the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him or his acquittal at first instance or on appeal (see paragraph 67 above). However, the Court notes that the courts to which Mr Gutsanov applied for release found his detention to be in accordance with domestic law ... It further notes that, according to the latest information received by the first applicant, the criminal proceedings in question are still pending at the preliminary investigation stage ... In these circumstances, an action under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act as in force at the relevant time would have been bound to fail.96. The Court also notes that any action lodged under section 2 of the above-mentioned Act in the event of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov or his acquittal would not have amounted to express or tacit acknowledgment of the breach of his right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Any such action would have had to establish that the damage in question had occurred as a result of charges being brought for a criminal offence in proceedings which were subsequently discontinued or ended in an acquittal. Accordingly, the examination of the facts by the domestic courts would have been confined to purely formal findings and would not have encompassed the actual substance of the applicants’ complaints, namely what they saw as the unnecessary nature of the methods employed by the police in order to achieve the objective of the operation, and the adverse psychological effects of the law-enforcement operation on the four applicants.97. In sum, the Court considers that, because of the deficiencies in the domestic legislation, neither the criminal complaint nor the action for damages against the State referred to by the Government would have constituted sufficiently effective domestic remedies in the instant case. The criminal remedy would have been bound to fail because of the absence of any provisions in Bulgarian law making it an offence to inflict psychological suffering (see paragraphs 90-92 above), while an action for compensation against the State would have been ineffective because of the limited scope of the domestic courts’ review in the context of such proceedings (see paragraphs 94-96 above). The Government did not refer to any other remedy capable of affording redress to the applicants for the alleged violation of their rights under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of these considerations and of the arguments outlined above, the Court considers that the Government’s rejection of non-exhaustion should be rejected.(ii) Compliance with the other conditions of admissibility98. The Government also maintained that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention had been lodged prematurely as the preliminary investigation concerning Mr Gutsanov was still pending. The Court can discern no direct link between the criminal proceedings to which the Government referred and the applicants’ complaint: the proceedings in question are not designed to establish whether the agents of the State safeguarded the applicants’ physical well-being or dignity, but rather to ascertain whether Mr Gutsanov was guilty of conspiracy and of various other criminal offences linked to his position as chairman of Varna municipal council ...99. Even assuming that the Government expect the criminal proceedings to be discontinued or Mr Gutsanov to be acquitted, which would allow him to lodge a claim for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 95 above), the Court reiterates that an action of this kind could not lead to a finding of a violation of the applicants’ right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment during the police operation at their home (see paragraph 96 above). In view of these considerations, the Court cannot criticise the applicants for having applied to it before the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov were concluded. It follows that the present complaint is not premature and that the Government’s preliminary objection should be rejected.100. The Government also contended that the applicants had not complied with the six-month time-limit laid down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the six-month rule is closely linked to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as the six-month period runs from the date of the decision considered as final for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). Nevertheless, where no adequate remedy is available in domestic law, the six-month period in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place (see Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, § 155, ECHR 2005‑XI).101. In examining the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government, the Court noted that none of the remedies they referred to satisfied the effectiveness requirement under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Thus, in the present case, the start of the six-month period should be the date of the events giving rise to the complaint under Article 3, that is to say 31 March 2010. As the applicants lodged their application on 21 May 2010, the Court notes that the six-month time-limit for lodging an application with it was complied with in the instant case. The objection as to inadmissibility raised in this regard must therefore also be rejected.102. Lastly, the Government disputed the applicants’ victim status, arguing that they had not been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court considers that this objection should be joined to the examination of the merits of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. It notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Complaint concerning the lack of a criminal investigation into the events103. The Court observes that the applicants raised this complaint in their written observations of 6 January 2012. In examining the admissibility of their application under the substantive aspect of Article 3, however, it noted that any criminal complaint seeking the opening of an investigation into the events would be bound to fail from the outset in view of the absence of any provision in domestic law laying down criminal penalties in respect of acts committed by police officers which cause psychological suffering (see paragraph 92 above); this argument was, moreover, advanced by the applicants themselves (see paragraph 84 above).104. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled case-law, the starting-point of the six-month period for lodging an application with it is the date on which the act complained of occurred, where domestic law does not afford appropriate remedies (see paragraph 100 above). It therefore considers that, in the present case, the six-month period for lodging an application under the procedural limb of Article 3 started on 31 March 2010. The applicants formulated their complaint one year and nine months later. It follows that this complaint was submitted out of time and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.B. Merits1. The parties’ submissions(a) The applicants105. The applicants submitted that the manner in which the police operation at their home had been carried out was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. On 31 March 2010, before dawn, a group of masked and heavily armed police officers had forced their way into their house without prior authorisation. The special officers had entered Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi’s bedroom and pointed their weapons at the couple’s two minor daughters. Mr Gutsanov, an influential and respected politician, had been forced to kneel down and been handcuffed.106. In the applicants’ view, there had been no reason for the police operation to be planned and carried out in this manner, in particular as Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi were respectable people who were well known in the city. Neither of them had a criminal record and there had been no reason to suppose that they would offer resistance to the law-enforcement officers. The search of their home did not constitute an urgent investigative measure under Article 161 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the applicants, all these elements pointed to a real intention to intimidate them, undermine their dignity and induce a feeling of powerlessness in the face of the actions of the law-enforcement officers.107. The police officers’ actions had had an adverse psychological impact on the applicants. In particular, Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, aged five and seven, had been subjected to considerable psychological pressure, as noted by the psychiatrists who had examined them shortly after the events in issue. Mr Gutsanov, a respected politician belonging to an opposition political party, had been the victim of a brutal arrest which had been widely covered in the media and which, together with the arrests of other politicians, formed part of a propaganda campaign by the ruling party. The psychological effects of the treatment complained of had been sufficiently severe to exceed the threshold required by Article 3 and for the treatment in question to be characterised as “degrading”.(b) The Government108. The Government contested the applicants’ allegations and their version of events. They submitted that the police operation of 31 March 2010 had been planned meticulously and carried out in a way which respected the applicants’ dignity and their rights. Mr Gutsanov’s arrest and the search of his home had been carried out in the context of a criminal investigation into serious offences involving several suspected accomplices. The police had been informed that Mr Gutsanov kept a gun in his home.109. The police operation had been launched after sunrise, that is to say after 6 a.m. The police had knocked on the gate of the applicants’ property, announced their presence and requested that the metal gate be opened. The security guard had opened the gate but explained that he did not have a key to the front door of the house. The police had run towards the door and knocked on it, demanding that it be opened immediately. Mr Gutsanov had appeared twice at the window of the house; he had seen and identified the police by their uniforms but had not come down to open the door. At that point, fearing that he might destroy evidence, fetch his firearm or try to escape, the special officers had forced open the door of the house. They had apprehended Mr Gutsanov on the second floor while he was trying to enter a bedroom where his wife and two children were.110. According to the Government, Mr Gutsanov had not been forced to kneel down. The officers had placed the handcuffs on him without using special immobilisation techniques and they had not pointed their weapons at his wife and daughters. The only officer who had gone into the bedroom on the second floor had been carrying only an electric stun gun and had not addressed the children or Mrs Gutsanova. The special officers had stayed in the house for only a few minutes and had left the premises after Mr Gutsanov’s arrest. Shortly afterwards, the applicant’s handcuffs had been removed.111. The police officers’ actions had complied with domestic law. The search had been approved by a judge within twenty-four hours of being carried out and the regional public prosecutor’s office, on the basis of the information supplied by the authorities, had found that the police officers had not committed any criminal offence.112. The Government conceded that the entry of the police into their home, and the search of the house, had undoubtedly aroused negative feelings in the applicants. However, they submitted that these were the normal and inevitable consequence of this kind of investigative measure; hence, the unpleasantness caused had not exceeded the threshold of severity beyond which Article 3 of the Convention applied. This was borne out, for instance, by the fact that the elder of the two girls had been taken to school as usual. The Government also maintained that if Mr Gutsanov had opened the front door of the house, the police officers would not have needed to resort to special measures to enter his home, which would have spared the members of his family the unpleasantness they had experienced.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Establishment of the facts113. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention must be supported by appropriate evidence. To establish the facts, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Salman, cited above, § 100).114. The Court notes that the events surrounding the police operation at the home of the four applicants were not the subject of any review by the domestic courts. When faced with similar situations, the Court has carried out its own assessment of the facts while complying with the rules laid down by its own case-law (see, by way of example, Sashov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 14383/03, § 48, 7 January 2010).115. On the basis of these principles, the Court deems it appropriate to take as the starting-point of its analysis the circumstances not disputed between the parties and the evidence adduced by them. It will also take into account those allegations by the parties which are sufficiently corroborated by the undisputed facts and the evidence adduced.116. It is not disputed between the parties that the police operation at the applicants’ home began shortly after 6.30 a.m. on 31 March 2010. The footage from the property’s CCTV cameras made available to the Court, and the weather report from the Varna meteorological service, corroborated the applicants’ allegation that the operation took place before sunrise, mainly around dawn (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).117. The parties also agree that the police operations team was made up of uniformed officers, plain clothes officers and special officers who were armed and masked. The video footage submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 21 above) and the reports submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 27 above) corroborate this.118. The fact that there was a firearm and ammunition in the applicants’ home is also undisputed and is established by the search report. It is clear from the Government’s observations and the reports they submitted that the police officers had been alerted by their superior officers to the presence of the weapon (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above).119. It is also common ground between the parties that the gate to the applicants’ property was opened voluntarily by the security guard at the request of the police officers (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above). Moreover, the scene was filmed and recorded by the property’s CCTV system (see paragraph 21 above). The parties also agree that the security guard informed the police officers of the identity of those present in the house and the fact that he did not have a key to the front door, and that the door was forced by the special officers who entered the house and arrested Mr Gutsanov (see paragraphs 13, 14, 24 and 25 above).120. Neither of the parties disputes the fact that the applicants were not physically injured during the police operation. The certificates attesting to the psychiatric examinations carried out on Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above) were not disputed by the Government.121. The first discrepancy between the parties’ version of events concerns the description of Mr Gutsanov’s conduct. According to the Government, he appeared twice at one of the windows of the house, saw the police officers and heard their calls but did not open the front door (see paragraph 25 above). The first applicant, meanwhile, stated that he had not realised that it was a police operation until the special officers entered the house and began to climb the stairs (see paragraph 16 above).122. The evidence available to the Court does not enable it to determine whether the applicant did actually appear at the window of his house and deliberately refused to open the front door to the police officers. However, it notes that it is not disputed that the police officers knocked at the front gate of the property and announced their presence to the security guard by calling out. According to the police officers, they then knocked on the front door of the house and called out “Police! Open up!”. This assertion is corroborated by the statements made by Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi, according to which they were woken by shouts and knocking at the door of the house (see paragraph 15 above). Mr Gutsanov stated that he had gone down to the first floor of the house to fetch the two children before going back up to the bedroom on the second floor. This claim was corroborated by the version of the police officers who saw the outline of a man through the windows of the house (see paragraph 25 above).123. As to the exact place in which Mr Gutsanov was arrested, the Court observes that he himself admitted in his statement that when the police officers forced the door and issued verbal warnings, he had run up to the bedroom on the second floor where his wife and children were (see paragraph 16 above). The Court is not in a position to determine whether Mr Gutsanov was arrested inside the bedroom on the second floor of the house, as he claimed, or on the second-floor landing after he had come out of the bedroom of his own volition, as claimed by the Government. Nor has it been established beyond any reasonable doubt that the police officers spoke to Mrs Gutsanova and asked her to cover the children with the duvet. In any event the Court observes that, according to the witness evidence given by the special officers (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), they saw Mr Gutsanov’s wife and children inside the bedroom when they went up to the second floor of the house in pursuit of Mr Gutsanov. The Court accepts that Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters also saw the armed and masked men, if only through the bedroom door.124. In the Court’s view, Mr Gutsanov’s claim that he was forced to kneel down so that the police officers could place the handcuffs on him has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. As regards the handcuffing, it is not disputed that the special officers placed handcuffs on Mr Gutsanov downstairs (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court observes that neither of the parties specified the length of time for which Mr Gutsanov remained in handcuffs. In any event, it cannot but observe that there is no evidence in the file to demonstrate that the first applicant was made to appear in handcuffs before the cameras of the journalists who had gathered outside the entrance to the property that day. Furthermore, the photograph taken as he was leaving the house, at around 1 p.m., shows no signs of him being handcuffed ... Accordingly, the Court considers that the present case falls to be distinguished in that regard from the case of Mirosław Garlicki, (cited above, § 75), in which the applicant was arrested at his workplace in front of his colleagues and patients, placed in handcuffs and filmed.(b) Compliance with Article 3 in the instant case125. The Court reiterates that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000‑IV). Psychological suffering may result from a situation in which State agents deliberately instil fear in individuals by threatening to kill or ill-treat them (see Hristovi, cited above, § 80).126. Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force by police officers during an arrest. Nevertheless, the use of force must be proportionate and absolutely necessary in the circumstances of the case (see, among many other authorities, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 76, ECHR 2000‑XII, and Altay v. Turkey, no. 22279/93, § 54, 22 May 2001). In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 56, Reports 1997‑VIII). The Court reiterates in particular that any recourse by agents of the State to physical force against a person which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, § 59, 28 July 2009). This strict proportionality test has also been applied by the Court in situations where the individuals concerned were already in the hands of the law‑enforcement agencies (see, among other authorities, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269; Rehbock, cited above, §§ 68-78; and Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, §§ 52-65, 24 January 2008).127. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the operation pursued the legitimate aim of carrying out an arrest, a search and a seizure of items as well as the public-interest objective of prosecuting criminal offences. The Court must be satisfied that a fair balance was struck in the circumstances of the case between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. It notes that, although the four applicants were not physically injured in the course of the impugned police operation, the latter necessarily entailed a degree of physical force. The front door of the house was forced open by the special operations team, Mr Gutsanov was immobilised by masked armed officers, led downstairs by force and handcuffed. The Court must therefore establish whether this use of physical force was proportionate and absolutely necessary in the instant case.128. The aim of the police operation at the applicants’ home that day was to arrest Mr Gutsanov, who was a suspect in a criminal case concerning misappropriation of public funds, and to carry out a search of the premises to look for physical and documentary evidence in the context of the same criminal investigation. It emerges from the evidence in the file that the investigation in question had been opened five months previously, that there were several suspects in the case and that the authorities suspected the existence of a conspiracy (see paragraph 9 ... above). The case clearly did not concern a group of individuals suspected of committing violent criminal acts.129. With regard to Mr Gutsanov’s personality, the Court observes that he was a well-known political figure in Varna: at the material time he was Chairman of the city’s municipal council. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the file to suggest that he had a history of violence or that he might have presented a danger to the police officers conducting the operation at his home.130. It is true that Mr Gutsanov was the lawful owner of a firearm and ammunition which he kept at his home. This fact was known to the police and had been specifically mentioned at the briefing of the police team before the operation (see paragraph 23 above). This was undoubtedly a relevant factor which had to be taken into account by the officers during the operation at the applicants’ home. However, the Court considers that the presence of the weapon in the applicants’ home was not sufficient in itself to justify the deployment of a special operations team or the degree of force that was used in the instant case.131. It is clear from the file that the possible presence of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and minor children was not taken into consideration at any stage in planning and carrying out the police operation. The fact was not mentioned during the pre-operation briefing (see paragraph 23 above) and the police officers apparently paid no heed to the warning by the security guard that young children were present in the house (see paragraph 24 above).132. Of course, the Court cannot go so far as to require the law‑enforcement agencies not to arrest persons suspected of criminal offences in their homes whenever their children or spouses are present. However, it considers that the possible presence of family members at the scene of an arrest is a circumstance that must be taken into consideration in planning and carrying out this type of police operation. This was not done in the present case and the law-enforcement agencies did not contemplate any alternative means of carrying out the operation at the applicants’ home, such as staging the operation at a later hour or even deploying a different type of officer in the operation. Consideration of the legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her daughters was especially necessary since the former was not under suspicion of involvement in the criminal offences of which her husband was suspected, and her two daughters were psychologically vulnerable because they were so young (five and seven years of age).133. The Court also observes that the lack of prior judicial review of the necessity and lawfulness of the search left the planning of the operation entirely at the discretion of the police and the criminal investigation bodies and did not enable the rights and legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters to be taken into consideration. In the Court’s view, such prior judicial review, in the specific circumstances of the present case, would have enabled their legitimate interests to be weighed against the public-interest objective of arresting persons suspected of committing a criminal offence.134. As regards the psychological effects of the police operation on the applicants, the Court observes that police operations which entail intervention in the home and the arrest of suspects inevitably arouse negative emotions in the persons targeted. However, in the present case, there is concrete, undisputed evidence that Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters were very severely affected by the events. Mrs Gutsanova consulted a psychiatrist on two occasions complaining of insomnia and acute anxiety and was prescribed tranquillisers (see paragraph 31 above). The two girls were also examined by a psychiatrist who observed that, when recalling the events, they reacted by crying or displaying acute anxiety (see paragraph 30 above). Mrs Gutsanova stated that her younger daughter, B., had started stammering again (see paragraph 28 above). As for S., the couple’s elder daughter, the statements by her aunt and her schoolteacher indicated that she had been deeply affected by the police operation at her home and by her father’s arrest (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also considers that the fact that the police operation took place in the early morning and involved special officers wearing masks, who were seen by Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, served to heighten the feelings of fear and anxiety experienced by these three applicants, to the extent that the treatment to which they were subjected exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 of the Convention to apply. The Court therefore considers that these three applicants were subjected to degrading treatment.135. As regards the adverse psychological effects of the police operation on Mr Gutsanov, the Court cannot but observe that the first applicant did not produce any medical evidence to this effect. Nevertheless, he stated that the humiliation and anxiety he had experienced during the heavy-handed operation to arrest him, in front of the members of his family, had been sufficiently intense for Article 3 to apply in his case (see paragraph 107 above).136. The Court reiterates its findings to the effect that the police operation in question was planned and carried out without regard for a number of relevant factors such as the nature of the criminal offences of which Mr Gutsanov was suspected, the fact that he had no history of violence, and the possible presence of his wife and daughters in the family home. All these elements point clearly to the excessive nature of the deployment of special officers and special procedures in order to arrest the first applicant and enable the police to enter his home. The Court considers that, in the light of these circumstances, the manner in which Mr Gutsanov’s arrest was carried out – very early in the morning, by several armed and masked officers who forced their way in through the door of the house, and under the frightened gaze of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and two young daughters – aroused strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness in the first applicant, capable of humiliating and debasing him in his own eyes and in the eyes of his close relatives. The Court considers that the intensity of these feelings exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 to apply. Accordingly, Mr Gutsanov too was subjected to degrading treatment.137. In conclusion, having taken into account all the relevant circumstances in the present case, the Court considers that the police operation at the applicants’ home was not planned and carried out in such a way as to ensure that the means employed were strictly necessary in order to attain the ultimate objectives of arresting a person suspected of committing criminal offences and gathering evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. The four applicants were subjected to a psychological ordeal which aroused in them strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness and which, on account of its adverse effects, amounted to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3. There has therefore been a violation of that provision in the present case....FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Decides to join to the merits the Government’s objection regarding the applicants’ victim status in respect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention;2. Declares, unanimously, the complaints concerning Article 3 admissible ...;3.

The applicant complained that his return to Iraq would involve a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Admissibility20. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been invoked or established. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. The submissions of the parties(a) The applicant21. The applicant claimed that, should he be returned to Baghdad or other parts of Iraq, he would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. He pointed out that the Christian minority was still in a vulnerable position in southern and central Iraq and that the authorities there could not guarantee the safety for Christians.22. The applicant referred to his statements made during the Swedish asylum proceedings. In his view, he had shown that he had been and further risked personal persecution and attacks due to his belonging to the Christian minority. He added that, while he had not been in Iraq since 2007, there was no indication that the threats against him were no longer relevant.23. As regards internal relocation, the applicant submitted that the security situation in the Kurdistan Region had recently deteriorated. He also maintained that a reference person was required in order to settle in that region. He had no family or relatives there, and would thus not be able to present a reference to the Kurdish authorities. Consequently, relocation to the Kurdistan Region was neither possible nor reasonable for him.24. The applicant also mentioned that, while he had been separated from and in conflict with his wife, they had recently reunited (thus, in early 2012) and were planning to live together.(b) The Government25. The Government acknowledged that country-of-origin information showed that the general security situation in the southern and central parts of Iraq was still serious and that Christians was one of the more exposed groups. Furthermore, recent information suggested that professionals such as academics, judges and lawyers, doctors and other medical personnel as well as athletes had been prime targets for various extremist groups. However, the Government maintained that there was no general need of protection for all Christians or for all members of other groups in Iraq and, that, consequently, assessments of protection needs should be made on an individual basis.26. As to the applicant’s personal situation, the Government submitted that the applicant had failed to substantiate that there was a connection between the threats he had received from the Mujahedin and the kidnapping of his son, on the one hand, and the threats and assaults to which his wife had been subjected, on the other. Taking into account also the five years that had passed since the applicant had left Iraq, the Government considered that it had not been established that he would run a personal risk of ill-treatment if returned to Iraq.27. In any event, referring to international reports on Iraq as well as information obtained from the Migration Board, the Government contended that there was an internal flight alternative for the applicant in the three northern governorates of the Kurdistan Region. Allegedly, he would be able to enter without any restrictions or sponsor requirements into this region, which had been identified as the safest and most stable in Iraq, and he would be able to settle there, with access to the same public services as other residents. As to the applicant’s personal circumstances in relation to the possibility to relocate internally, the Government stressed that he is an adult man, born in 1968, and that no information had emerged about his health or any other circumstances that indicated that he was not fit for work. Thus, he would be able to provide for himself, even in an area of Iraq where he lacked a social network.28. The Government further asserted that the Migration Board and the courts had provided the applicant with effective guarantees against arbitrary refoulement and had made thorough assessments, adequately and sufficiently supported by national and international source materials. In the proceedings, the applicant had been given many opportunities to present his case, through interviews conducted by the Board with an interpreter present and by being invited to submit written submissions, at all stages assisted by legal counsel. Moreover, having regard to the expertise held by the migration bodies, the Government maintained that significant weight should be given to their findings.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles29. The Court reiterates that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, for example, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, § 67; Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997‑VI, p. 2264, § 42; and Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006-XII). However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-125, ECHR 2008-...).30. The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assesses the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, § 40).31. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, § 96; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, § 128). It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker’s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007; and Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37913/05, 27 March 2008).32. In cases concerning the expulsion of asylum seekers, the Court does not itself examine the actual asylum applications or verify how the States honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. It must be satisfied, though, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other contracting or non-contracting states, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 119, 17 July 2008).(b) The general situation in Iraq33. The Court notes that a general situation of violence will not normally in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of an expulsion (H.L.R. v. France, cited above, § 41). However, the Court has never excluded the possibility that the general situation of violence in a country of destination may be of a sufficient level of intensity as to entail that any removal to it would necessarily breach Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases of general violence, where there is a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 115).34. While the international reports on Iraq attest to a continued difficult situation, including indiscriminate and deadly attacks by violent groups, discrimination as well as heavy-handed treatment by authorities, it appears that the overall situation is slowly improving. In the case of F.H. v. Sweden (no. 32621/06, § 93, 20 January 2009), the Court, having at its disposal information material upto and including the year 2008, concluded that the general situation in Iraq was not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of a person’s return to that country. Taking into account the international and national reports available today, the Court sees no reason to alter the position taken in this respect four years ago.35. However, the applicant did not only claim that the general situation in Iraq was too unsafe for his return, but also that his status as a member of the Christian minority would put him at real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3.(c) The situation of Christians in Iraq36. In the mentioned case of F.H. v. Sweden, following its conclusion that the general situation in Iraq was not sufficient to preclude all returns to the country, the Court had occasion to examine the risks facing the applicant on account of his being Christian. It concluded then that he would not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment on the basis of his religious affiliation alone. In so doing, the Court had regard to the occurrence of attacks against Christians, some of them deadly, but found that they had been carried out by individuals rather than organised groups and that the applicant would be able to seek protection from the Iraqi authorities who would be willing and able to help him (§ 97 of the judgment).37. During the subsequent four years, attacks on Christians have continued, including the attack on 31 October 2010 on the Catholic church Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad, claiming more than 50 victims. The available evidence rather suggests that, in comparison with 2008/09, such violence has escalated. While still the great majority of civilians killed in Iraq are Muslims, a high number of attacks have been recorded in recent years which appear to have specifically targeted Christians and been conducted by organised extremist groups. As noted by the UNHCR (see M.Y.H. and Others, § 25) and others, Christians form a vulnerable minority in the southern and central parts of Iraq, either directly because of their faith or because of their perceived wealth or connections with foreign forces and countries or the practice of some of them to sell alcohol. The UK Border Agency concluded in December 2011 that the authorities in these parts of the country were generally unable to protect Christians and other religious minorities (M.Y.H. and Others, § 26).38. The question arises whether the vulnerability of the Christian group and the risks which the individuals face on account of their faith make it impossible to return members of this group to Iraq without violating their rights under Article 3. The Court considers, however, that it need not determine this issue, as there is an internal relocation alternative available to them in the Kurdistan Region. This will be examined in the following.(d) The possibility of relocation to the Kurdistan Region39. The Court reiterates that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight or relocation alternative in their assessment of an individual’s claim that a return to the country of origin would expose him or her to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision. However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of ill‑treatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, § 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).40. The three northern governorates – Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah – forming the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, or KRI, are, according to international sources, a relatively safe area. While there have been incidents of violence and threats, the rights of Christians are generally considered to be respected. As noted by various sources, large numbers of Christians have travelled to the Kurdistan Region and found refuge there.41. As regards the possibility of entering the KRI, some sources state that the border checks are often inconsistent, varying not only from governorate to governorate but also from checkpoint to checkpoint (see the UNHCR Guidelines and the Finnish/Swiss report, which appears to rely heavily on the UNHCR’s conclusions in this respect, M.Y.H. and Others, §§ 30 and 35 respectively). However, the difficulties faced by some at the KRI checkpoints do not seem to be relevant for Christians. This has been noted by, among others, the UNHCR. Rather, members of the Christian group are given preferential treatment as compared to others wishing to enter the Kurdistan Region. As stated by a representative of an international organisation and the head of Asaysih, the KRI general security authority, to investigators of the Danish/UK fact-finding mission, this is because Christians are at particular risk of terrorist attacks in southern and central Iraq and as the Christians are not considered to pose any terrorist threat themselves (at 4.34 and 8.19 of the report, M.Y.H. and Others, § 36).42. Moreover, while Christians may be able to enter the three northern governorates without providing any documentation at all (see Danish/UK report, at 4.34), in any event there does not seem to be any difficulty to obtain identity documents in case old ones have been lost. As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, § 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, § 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI. It appears that the UNHCR is of the same opinion as regards entry, although its statement in the Guidelines directly concerns only the requirements of a tourist (M.Y.H. and Others, § 30). The Finnish/Swiss report states that Christians may be able to nominate senior clerics as sponsors (M.Y.H. and Others, § 35); thus, they do not have to have a personal acquaintance to vouch for them.43. Internal relocation inevitably involves certain hardship. Various sources have attested that people who relocate to the Kurdistan Region may face difficulties, for instance, in finding proper jobs and housing there, not the least if they do not speak Kurdish. Nevertheless, the evidence before the Court suggests that there are jobs available and that settlers have access to health care as well as financial and other support from the UNHCR and local authorities. In any event, there is no indication that the general living conditions in the KRI for a Christian settler would be unreasonable or in any way amount to treatment prohibited by Article 3. Nor is there a real risk of his or her ending up in the other parts of Iraq.44. In conclusion, therefore, the Court considers that relocation to the Kurdistan Region is a viable alternative for a Christian fearing persecution or ill-treatment in other parts of Iraq. The reliance by a Contracting State on such an alternative would thus not, in general, give rise to an issue under Article 3.(e) The particular circumstances of the applicant45. It remains for the Court to determine whether, despite what has been stated above, the personal circumstances of the applicant would make it unreasonable for him to settle in the Kurdistan Region. In this respect, the Court first notes that the applicant’s account was examined by the Migration Board and the Migration Court, which both gave extensive reasons for their decisions that he was not in need of protection in Sweden. The applicant was able to present the arguments he wished with the assistance of legal counsel and language interpretation.46. As regards the suffering which the applicant and his family experienced in Iraq, the Court notes, without underestimating their serious nature, that they all occurred in Baghdad. It has not been shown that he would be at risk in the Kurdistan Region, and the applicant’s misgivings as to the possibility for him to settle there are not supported by the information on the KRI available to the Court.47. The Court notes that the applicant’s wife and daughter have been granted permanent residence permits in Sweden and that the wife was expected to give birth to another child in October 2012. The applicant’s deportation would inevitably separate the applicant from his wife and children, at least temporarily, but the applicant may apply for a residence permit based on family ties upon his return to Iraq. It should further be borne in mind that the applicant has not complained, at any stage of the proceedings in the present case, of a violation of his right to respect for his family life. Should a future request for a residence permit based on family ties be rejected by the Swedish authorities, he is free to submit a new application to the Court under Article 8 of the Convention, supplying the Court with all the information necessary for it to examine whether his right under that provision has been respected.(f) Conclusion48. Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that, although the applicant, as Christian, belongs to a vulnerable minority and irrespective of whether he can be said to face, as a member of that group, a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the southern and central parts of Iraq, he may reasonably relocate to the Kurdistan Region, where he will not face such a risk. Neither the general situation in that region, including that of the Christian minority, nor any of the applicant’s personal circumstances indicate the existence of said risk.Consequently, his deportation to Iraq would not involve a violation of Article 3.II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT49. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.50. It considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see § 4 above) must continue in force until the present judgment becomes final or until the Court takes a further decision in this connection (see operative part).FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Declares unanimously the application admissible;2. Holds by five votes to two that the implementation of the deportation order against the applicant would not give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Decides unanimously to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until such time as the present judgment becomes final or until further order.Done in English, and notified in writing on 27 June 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Claudia Westerdiek Mark Villiger Registrar PresidentIn accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge Power-Forde joined by Judge Zupančič is annexed to this judgment.M.V.C.W.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v. Sweden, I voted against the majority in finding that Article 3 would not be breached in the event that the deportation order made in respect of this applicant were to be executed. My dissent was based on the failure of the majority to test whether the requisite guarantees required by the Court’s case law prior to a deportation based on internal flight options, were established in this case.However, apart from that question of principle in relation to internal flight options, I have serious doubts as to whether the applicant’s deportation would, in any event, be in compliance with Article 3 of the Convention.The applicant is a 45-year-old man from Baghdad who was and is an active member of the Syrian Orthodox church. He lived with his wife and two children in Baghdad. He has had a particularly severe history of suffering during the war in Iraq because of his religious belief. In February 2007 his wife received threatening letters warning her to leave her job teaching Arabic at an Iraqi university. His family was required to go into hiding. His son was abducted and strangled and his remains were dumped on a street. The police authorities were informed but little was done. A similar threat was then made on his daughter’s life. Eventually, the applicant and his family fled to Syria in September 2007 and, thereafter, the applicant went to Sweden to seek asylum.In the meantime, and having regard to the deteriorating situation in Syria, the applicant’s wife returned to Baghdad in 2010 in search of work. She was kidnapped, attacked and raped by a group of men. She finally came to Sweden with her daughter where both of them were granted asylum.Clearly, the applicant and his wife and daughter were separated for some time, not least, as a consequence of the legacy of war in their home country. However, it is equally clear that the applicant has since reunited with his wife and daughter and that they have been living together for some time. A third child has been born of their marriage in October 2012.Having regard to what the applicant has already endured—the loss of his home, the death of his son, the flight of his family, the assaults upon his wife, the fracturing of their relationship and the ultimate reunification of his family—the suffering that would be imposed upon him by separating him, once again, from his family and his newborn child and by forcing him to return to Iraq—would, to my mind, cross the threshold of suffering required by Article 3.I appreciate that the applicant’s claim is not brought under Article 8 of the Convention. I also recognise that the threat under Article 3 must be assessed in terms of future risk. However, when assessing future risk one has to have regard to the individual circumstances of each case and to the level of suffering to which an individual has already been exposed. Such previous experience may be sufficient to break a person’s moral or psychological resistance in the event that he or she is further exposed to additional suffering.To my mind, given what this applicant has already endured it would be inhuman and degrading to separate him once again from his immediate family, which he has finally managed to hold together despite the trauma of war. The additional suffering that this would entail would be sufficient, to my mind, to break his moral and psychological resistance and would extend beyond the level permitted by Article 3 of the Convention.The expulsion of a person on the basis that internal flight relocation is available may, in altogether different circumstances, be compatible with Article 3. However, having regard to the circumstances of this applicant’s case, his expulsion to Iraq would not, in my view. be compatible with that Article of the Convention.It is formalistic in the extreme to expect that the applicant should be forced to leave his wife and children, once again, purely for the purposes of travelling to the Kurdish region so that, from there, he may contact a Swedish Embassy and apply for family reunification.Therefore, both for the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in M.Y.H. and Others v Sweden and on the merits of this case, I consider that the applicant’s removal to Iraq would violate Article 3.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v.

ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION31. The applicant alleged that if he were returned to Uzbekistan he would run a real risk of being subjected to torture and ill-treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, which provides as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Submissions by the parties1. The Government32. The Government submitted that in the course of the extradition proceedings the competent Russian authorities had duly examined the applicant’s situation with regard to his return to Uzbekistan, where he would be prosecuted. In the Government’s opinion, the diplomatic assurances given by the Uzbek authorities were sufficient and compatible with the relevant provisions of international law.33. The Government further submitted that the applicant’s allegations about the risk of ill-treatment in the event of execution of the expulsion order of 18 October 2013 were speculative and “could not be considered by the [domestic] court during the administrative proceedings”. Nevertheless, they had been thoroughly reviewed and found to be unsubstantiated by the Moscow City Court. In any event, the expulsion order did not specify that the applicant was to be expelled to Uzbekistan, but merely stated that he was to be removed from the territory of the Russian Federation. The Government concluded that a risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention had not been convincingly established.2. The applicant34. Firstly, the applicant submitted that he had raised the issue of the risk of his being subjected to ill-treatment if returned to Uzbekistan in the extradition, expulsion and refugee-status proceedings, advancing a number of specific arguments, such as an increased risk of ill-treatment of persons who, like the applicant, were accused of participation in a banned religious activity and those who were suspected of crimes against State security, as had been reliably demonstrated by the international organisations’ reports on the situation in Uzbekistan and the Court’s judgments regarding that matter. However, the Russian courts had failed to analyse the nature of the charges against the applicant, had disregarded the link between the charges and the risk of ill-treatment and had not examined the information from various international organisations or the Court’s case-law.35. As to the Russian Government’s reliance on the diplomatic assurances provided by Uzbekistan in the context of the extradition proceedings, the applicant considered them to be insufficient. He referred, in particular, to Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11, §§ 149-50, 2 October 2012, in this connection.36. Lastly, the applicant contested the Government’s argument that the decision on administrative removal did not necessarily mean that he would be expelled to Uzbekistan. He stated that the expulsion proceedings had been initiated by the Moscow deputy prosecutor’s request of 17 October 2013 which mentioned “the date of his actual handing over to the competent authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan”, and that no other possibility had ever been discussed in the course of those proceedings. The applicant further submitted that there existed an administrative practice of substituting expulsion for extradition which was based on an unpublished order of the Moscow Region prosecutor, no. 86/81 of 3 July 2009, which provided that whenever a detained individual was released on the grounds that his extradition was impossible, it was mandatory to decide on his administrative expulsion from Russia. The applicant therefore maintained that his expulsion had been ordered to secure his rendition to the Uzbekistani authorities and thus to prevent him from being released and to secure either his expulsion or his extradition.B. The Court’s assessment1. Admissibility37. The Court observes firstly that as Uzbekistan’s extradition request is pending before the competent Russian authorities, it is only called upon to examine the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention in relation to the expulsion proceedings.38. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Merits39. The Court will examine the merits of the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 in the light of the applicable general principles set out in, among others, Umirov v. Russia (no. 17455/11, §§ 92-100, 18 September 2012, with further references).40. In the recent cases against the Russian Federation examined under Article 3 concerning the extradition of applicants to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the Court has identified the critical elements to be subjected to searching scrutiny (see, among many other authorities, Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts); Kasymakhunov v. Russia, no. 29604/12, 14 November 2013; Abdulkhakov v. Russia, cited above; and Iskandarov v. Russia, no. 17185/05, 23 September 2010). Consideration must first be given to whether an applicant has provided the national authorities with substantial grounds for believing that he faces a real risk of ill‑treatment in the destination country. Secondly, the Court will examine whether the claim was adequately assessed by the competent national authorities, discharging their procedural obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, and whether their conclusions were sufficiently supported by relevant material. Lastly, having regard to all the substantive aspects of a case and the available relevant information, the Court will assess the existence of a real risk of suffering torture or treatment incompatible with the Convention standards.(a) Existence of substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faced a real risk of ill-treatment41. At the outset, the Court reiterates that for more than a decade the United Nations human rights bodies and relevant agencies and international non-governmental organisations have issued alarming reports concerning the situation in the criminal justice system in Uzbekistan, the use of torture and ill‑treatment techniques by law-enforcement agencies, severe conditions in detention facilities, systemic persecution of political opposition, and harsh treatment of certain religious groups.42. The Court has previously had the task of examining many cases concerning the forced return from Russia to Uzbekistan of persons accused by the Uzbek authorities of criminal, religious and political activities (see, most recently, Egamberdiyev cited above; Akram Karimov v. Russia, no. 62892/12, 28 May 2014; and Nizamov and Others v. Russia, nos. 22636/13, 24034/13, 24334/13 and 24528/13, 7 May 2014, with further references). It has been the Court’s constant position that individuals whose extradition was sought by the Uzbek authorities on charges of religiously or politically motivated crimes constituted a vulnerable group, running a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention in the event of their transfer to Uzbekistan.43. In the present case, the applicant consistently and specifically argued – in the extradition, expulsion and refugee-status proceedings – that he had been prosecuted for religious extremism and crimes against the State and therefore was a member of the above-mentioned vulnerable group. This was borne out by the extradition documents which were produced by the requesting Uzbekistani authority. The basis for the arrest warrant and extradition request submitted by the Uzbek authorities was clear: the applicant was wanted for prosecution in Uzbekistan on charges of religious and political extremism. These allegations regarding his criminal conduct and its nature remained unchanged throughout the relevant proceedings in the Russian Federation.44. This fact alone, taken in the context of the international reports regarding the systemic ill-treatment of those accused of religious and political crimes, was sufficient to place the applicant definitively within the group of individuals at a severe risk of ill-treatment in the event of their removal to Uzbekistan.45. In the light of the above considerations, the Court is satisfied that the Russian authorities had before them a sufficiently corroborated claim that the applicant faced a real risk of ill-treatment if returned to Uzbekistan.(b) Duty to assess adequately claims of a real risk of ill-treatment relying on sufficient relevant material46. The Court will next examine whether the Russian authorities discharged their obligation to undertake an adequate assessment of the applicant’s claim that he risked being subjected to ill-treatment in the event of his return.47. As regards the refugee-status proceedings, the Court observes that the decisions by the immigration authorities and the courts appear to give preponderant weight to the fact that the applicant had waited for too long before applying for refugee status, and that he had failed to substantiate his claim that he risked political or religious persecution. On the first point the Court reiterates that, whilst a person’s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, the domestic authorities’ findings as regards the failure to apply for refugee status in due time do not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention (see Ermakov v. Russia, no. 43165/10, § 196, 7 November 2013). On the second point, the Court emphasises that the criteria laid down for granting refugee status are not identical to those that are used for assessing the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant made detailed submissions about the risk of being subjected to ill-treatment if he were returned to his home country, relying on information from various international organisations and on the judgments of this Court. However, the domestic decisions only mentioned those submissions in passing and did not analyse them in any detail.48. As to the proceedings concerning the applicant’s administrative expulsion, the Court notes that the scope of the review by the domestic courts was largely confined to establishing the fact that the applicant’s presence in Russia had been illegal. In this connection the Court reiterates that, in view of the absolute nature of Article 3, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey, no. 30471/08, § 91, 22 September 2009). Therefore, the domestic courts’ findings as regards the applicant’s failure to abide by Russian laws do not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention.49. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant’s allegations that he risked ill-treatment were duly examined by the domestic authorities. It must, accordingly, assess whether there exists a real risk that the applicant would be subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 if he were to be removed to Uzbekistan.(c) Existence of a real risk of ill-treatment50. The Court notes that the Government pointed out in their observations that the decision on the applicant’s expulsion did not specify that he was to be expelled to Uzbekistan, but merely stated that he was to be removed from the territory of Russia. However, they did not provide information regarding any other country willing to accept him. The Court observes, moreover, that the expulsion proceedings were initiated by the prosecutor’s request directly referring to the “date of [the applicant’s] actual handing over to the competent authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan” (see paragraph 17 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but accept the applicant’s argument that no possibility of his expulsion to another country was discussed in the course of the expulsion proceedings. Accordingly, it concludes that the decision on the applicant’s administrative removal presupposed that he would be expelled to Uzbekistan.51. The Court has had occasion to deal with a number of cases raising the issue of a risk of ill-treatment in the event of extradition or expulsion to Uzbekistan from Russia or another Council of Europe member State. It has found, with reference to material from various sources, that the general situation with regard to human rights in Uzbekistan is alarming, that reliable international material has demonstrated the persistence of a serious issue of ill-treatment of detainees, the practice of torture against those in police custody being described as “systematic” and “indiscriminate”, and that there is no concrete evidence to demonstrate any fundamental improvement in that area (see Egamberdiyev, Akram Karimov, Kasymakhunov, Ermakov, Umirov, all cited above; see also Garayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 53688/08, § 71, 10 June 2010; Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, §§ 93-96, 11 December 2008; and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, no. 2947/06, § 121, 24 April 2008).52. As regards the applicant’s personal situation, the Court notes that he was wanted by the Uzbek authorities on charges related to his alleged membership of a Muslim extremist movement and threats to State security. Those charges constituted the basis for the extradition request and the arrest warrant issued in respect of the applicant. Thus, his situation is no different from that of other Muslims who, on account of practising their religion outside official institutions and guidelines, are charged with religious extremism or membership of banned religious organisations and, on that account, as noted in the reports and the Court’s judgments cited above, are at an increased risk of ill-treatment (see, in particular, Ermakov, cited above, § 203).53. The Court is bound to observe that the existence of domestic laws and international treaties guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights is not in itself sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment where, as in the present case, reliable sources have reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities that are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 27765/09, § 128, ECHR 2012). It has also been the Court’s established position that the diplomatic assurances are likewise incapable, on their own, to prevent the risk of ill-treatment from materialising and that the national authorities need to treat with caution the assurances against torture given by a State where torture is endemic or persistent (see Yuldashev v. Russia, no. 1248/09, § 85, 8 July 2010, with further references). Furthermore, the domestic authorities, as well as the Government in their submissions before the Court, used summary and non-specific reasoning in an attempt to dispel the allegations of a risk of ill-treatment on account of the above considerations.54. In view of the above, the Court considers that substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the applicant would face a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention if deported to Uzbekistan.55. The Court therefore concludes that the enforcement of the expulsion order against the applicant would give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION, TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 356. The applicant contended under Article 13 of the Convention that no effective remedies were available to him in respect of his allegations of possible ill-treatment in the event of his return to Uzbekistan. Article 13 reads as follows:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”57. The Court considers that the gist of the applicant’s claim under Article 13, which it finds admissible, is that the domestic authorities failed to carry out a rigorous scrutiny of the risk of ill-treatment that the applicant would face in the event of his forced removal to Uzbekistan. The Court has already examined that submission in the context of Article 3 of the Convention. Having regard to its findings above, the Court considers that there is no need to examine this complaint separately on its merits (see, for a similar approach, Gaforov v. Russia, no. 25404/09, § 144, 21 October 2010; Azimov v. Russia, no. 67474/11, § 145, 18 April 2013; and, most recently, Akram Karimov, cited above, § 137).III. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION58. The applicant complained that his detention pending expulsion after 17 October 2013 had been in breach of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention. He further complained, under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, that he had been unable to obtain a judicial review of that detention. The relevant parts of Article 5 provide as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:...(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition....4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful. ...”A. Admissibility59. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits60. The Court will consider firstly whether there existed a possibility of effective supervision of the applicant’s detention and secondly whether the applicant’s detention was compatible with the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (f) (see Kim v. Russia, no. 44260/13, § 38, 17 July 2014, and Azimov, cited above, § 146 et seq.)1. Compliance with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention61. The Government submitted that the applicant had been able to take part in all the hearings concerning his detention and to put forward his arguments about alleged violations of Article 5 of the Convention.62. The applicant emphasised that both the Zyuzinskiy District Court and the Moscow City Court had failed to consider his arguments relating to Article 5 of the Convention and that no time-limit for his detention had been stipulated in the expulsion order. With reference to the Court’s previous findings (in particular, in the case of Azimov, cited above, §§ 153‑54), he maintained that Russian law did not provide for a periodic review of the lawfulness of detention following a decision on administrative expulsion.63. The Court reiterates that the purpose of Article 5 § 4 is to guarantee to persons who are arrested and detained the right to judicial supervision of the lawfulness of the measure to which they are thereby subjected. A remedy must be made available during a person’s detention to allow that person to obtain speedy judicial review of its lawfulness. That review should be capable of leading, where appropriate, to release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 § 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Muminov, cited above, § 113, and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 145, with further references).64. The Court notes at the outset that a judicial review of the kind required under Article 5 § 4 cannot be said to be incorporated in the initial expulsion order of 18 October 2013. The thrust of the applicant’s complaint under Article 5 § 4 was not directed against the initial decision placing him in custody but rather against his inability to obtain a judicial review of his detention after a certain lapse of time. Detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) lasts, as a rule, for a significant period and depends on circumstances which are subject to change over time. Given that since the delivery of the City Court’s appeal judgment of 22 November 2013 the applicant has spent more than a year in custody, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen during that period. In such circumstances the Court considers that the requirement under Article 5 § 4 was neither incorporated in the initial detention order of 18 October 2013 nor fulfilled by the appeal court (see Rakhimov v. Russia, no. 50552/13, § 147).65. The Court reiterates that, since its Azimov judgment, which concerned a similar complaint (see Azimov, cited above, § 153), it has found a violation of Article 5 § 4 in a number of cases against Russia on account of the absence of any domestic legal provision which could have allowed the applicant to bring proceedings for judicial review of his detention pending expulsion (see Kim, cited above, §§ 39-43; Rakhimov, cited above, §§ 148-150; Akram Karimov, cited above, §§ 199-204; and also Egamberdiyev, cited above, § 64). In the Kim case, the Government acknowledged a violation of Article 5 § 4 and, having regard to the recurrent nature of the violation, the Court directed that the Russian authorities should “secure in [their] domestic legal order a mechanism which allows individuals to institute proceedings for the examination of the lawfulness of their detention pending removal in the light of the developments in the removal proceedings” (see Kim, cited above, § 71).66. As the applicant has not had at his disposal a procedure for a judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.2. Compliance with Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention(a) The parties’ submissions67. The Government submitted that the applicant’s detention pending both extradition and expulsion conformed to the relevant domestic provisions and the guarantees of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.68. The applicant did not question before the Court the lawfulness of his detention in the extradition proceedings from 17 April to 17 October 2013. As regards the detention imposed in the expulsion proceedings, he admitted that he had violated the immigration rules and failed to register his residence in Russia within the statutory time-limit, but claimed that the authorities had become aware of that fact on 17 April 2013, when he was arrested and found not to have a passport. However, it was not until six months later that the prosecutor instituted expulsion proceedings against him. The applicant claimed that the real purpose of the expulsion proceedings was to keep him under the authorities’ control in order to organise by any means his return to the country which sought his extradition. Other than the requirement that the expulsion order be executed within the two-year time-limit, the Code of Administrative Offences did not contain any provisions governing the length of detention pending expulsion and therefore lacked legal certainty. Moreover, the relevant provisions were open to the interpretation that by the expiry of that two-year time-limit the applicant would again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground. Lastly, the applicant claimed that such a long stay in detention significantly exceeded the maximum custodial sentence permissible under the Code of Administrative Offences and that his detention pending expulsion was of a punitive, rather than preventive, nature.(b) The Court’s assessment69. The Court observes that the applicant’s complaint refers to the period from 18 October 2013 to the present day, in which he has been detained with a view to his administrative removal (“expulsion”) from Russia (see paragraphs 17-20 above). Since administrative removal amounts to a form of “deportation” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention, that provision is applicable in the instant case.70. The Court reiterates that deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention must conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention must be appropriate; and the length of the detention must not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Azimov, cited above, § 161, and Rustamov v. Russia, no. 11209/10, § 150, 3 July 2012, with further references).71. It is common ground between the parties that the applicant had been residing illegally in Russia before his arrest and, therefore, had committed an administrative offence punishable by expulsion. The Court is satisfied that on 18 October 2013 his detention pending expulsion was ordered by a court with jurisdiction in the matter and in connection with an offence punishable by expulsion. On 22 November 2013 the City Court upheld that decision on appeal. The Court accordingly concludes that the authorities acted in compliance with the letter of the national law.72. In so far as the applicant claimed that the real purpose of the expulsion proceedings was to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the extradition proceedings, the Court reiterates that detention may be unlawful if its stated purpose differs from the real one (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, § 142, 31 May 2011; Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 42, ECHR 2002‑I: and Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, § 60). The Court reiterates that in Azimov it found that a decision ordering the applicant’s detention pending expulsion had served to circumvent the maximum time-limits laid down in the domestic law for detention pending extradition (see Azimov, cited above, § 165). However, it does not need to determine whether the same is true in the instant case because even where the purpose of detention is legitimate, its length should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Azimov, cited above, § 166, and Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, § 162, 5 June 2012).73. In the present case, before the authorities ordered the applicant’s detention pending expulsion he had already been in detention with a view to extradition for six months. When deciding to keep the applicant in custody pending expulsion, the courts did not set a specific time-limit for his detention. Under Article 31.9 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, an expulsion decision must be enforced within two years (see paragraph 27 above). Thus, after the expiry of such a period, a detainee should be released. This may happen in the present case; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences for the applicant’s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting the duration of detention of an illegal alien is not set out clearly in the law. It is also unclear what will happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Egamberdiyev, § 62, and Azimov, § 171, both cited above).74. The Court further notes that the maximum penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty for an administrative offence under the Code of Administrative Offences in force is thirty days (see paragraph 28 above), and that detention with a view to expulsion should not be punitive in nature and should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards, as established by the Russian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 29 above). In the present case the “preventive” measure was, paradoxically, much heavier than the “punitive” one (see Azimov, cited above, § 172).75. Lastly, the Court reiterates that there are no provisions of Russian law which could have allowed the applicant to bring proceedings for judicial review of his detention pending expulsion, and no automatic review of his detention at regular intervals (see Azimov, cited above, § 153).76. In view of the above considerations, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention.IV. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT77. The Court notes that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.78. The Court notes that the applicant is currently detained in Russia and is still formally liable to administrative removal pursuant to the final judgments of the Russian courts in this case. Having regard to the finding that he would face a serious risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment in Uzbekistan, the Court considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see paragraph 4 above) must remain in force until the present judgment becomes final or until further notice.V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION79. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage80. The applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage on account of distress and frustration caused by his detention pending expulsion, as well as on account of anxiety in view of the prospect of being returned to a country where he would be exposed to a risk of ill-treatment.81. The Government pointed out that, in so far as the applicant’s claim concerns the risk of ill-treatment upon return to Uzbekistan, Article 41 of the Convention does not allow for just satisfaction to be awarded for violations that have not yet been committed. Therefore, in their view, no compensation should be awarded to him. As regards the other issues in the present case, the Government considered that the fact of finding a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant.82. The Court observes that no breach of Article 3 of the Convention has yet occurred in the present case. However, it has found that the applicant’s forced return to Uzbekistan would, if implemented, give rise to a violation of that provision. The Court considers that its finding regarding Article 3 amounts in itself to adequate just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 41.83. The Court has found other violations of the Convention in the present case. It accepts that the applicant has suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation. It therefore awards the applicant EUR 7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.B. Costs and expenses84. The applicant also claimed EUR 7,440 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court. This included Ms Trenina’s and Ms Ryabinina’s work in representing the applicant in the domestic proceedings and before the Court. According to the table submitted by the applicant, Ms Trenina’s work consisted of forty-nine hours of work at an hourly rate of EUR 120, amounting to EUR 5,880, whereas Ms Ryabinina worked for thirteen hours at the same hourly rate, amounting to EUR 1,560.85. The Government noted that the applicant had provided a breakdown of the work performed by his representatives, but had submitted no agreement concerning legal assistance, or other documents setting out their hourly rates.86. According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 5,000, covering costs under all heads plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, and rejects the remainder of the claims under this head.C. Default interest87. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,1. Declares the application admissible;2. Holds that the forced return of the applicant to Uzbekistan would give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;4. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention;5. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention in respect of the applicant’s detention in the context of the expulsion proceedings;6. Decides to maintain the indication to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court until such time as the present judgment becomes final, or until further notice;7. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:(i) EUR 7,500 (seven thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;(ii) EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;8. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 26 February 2015, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Søren Nielsen Isabelle Berro Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2015-02-26 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-152601', 'appno': '66373/13', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'RUS', 'extractedappno': '66373/13;34742/13;14743/11;86/81;17455/11;71386/10;29604/12;17185/05;62892/12;22636/13;24034/13;24334/13;24528/13;43165/10;30471/08;53688/08;42502/06;2947/06;27765/09;1248/09;25404/09;67474/11;44260/13;50552/13;11209/10;5829/04;51564/99;55822/10', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Extradition;Expulsion) (Substantive aspect) (Uzbekistan);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-4 - Take proceedings);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1-f - Expulsion)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;620;618;448;130;481', 'doc_id': 'f7241303-ee51-4fc8-b9e5-30170506772b'}, page_content='Constitution.III.

The applicant complained, under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, of having contracted TB in prison, of insufficient medical care for his various diseases throughout the entire period of his detention, and of having been deprived of effective remedies in this respect. He further challenged the conditions of his detention in Rustavi nos. 1 and 6 Prisons in the periods between 18 July 2008 and 4 March 2010 and 23 July 2010 up to the present as inadequate. Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention read as follows:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A. Admissibility1. The parties’ arguments22. The Government argued that the complaint about poor conditions of detention was unsubstantiated. In support, they submitted two letters from the Governors of the prison facilities involved, describing in detail the conditions of the applicant’s detention. According to these letters, the applicant was being kept in satisfactory conditions; the sanitary and hygienic norms were met; he was allowed to take a shower at least once a week and had been provided with all basic items of hygiene. In Rustavi no. 1 Prison, an open-type prison, the applicant was allowed six hours’ outdoor exercise on a daily basis, whilst in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a closed institution, he had been allowed at least a one-hour walk per day. On the basis of the relevant service provider contracts, the Government further argued that the food available to the applicant in both establishments was prepared in accordance with the legally approved norms, and that the applicant was regularly provided with the basic items of hygiene. In sum, the conditions of the applicant’s detention were compatible with Article 3.23. As regards the applicant’s alleged infection with TB and the inadequacy of the medical treatment provided to him in prison, the Government submitted that these complaints were premature, as the applicant had neither filed, under the relevant administrative rules, complaints of a lack of medical care in prison, nor sought monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage under the relevant provisions of the General Administrative Code and the Civil Code. In support of the latter argument they submitted a case where the domestic authorities had awarded compensation for the death in detention of the plaintiff’s husband, which had been caused by a lack of appropriate medical treatment. This decision was adopted by the domestic court in the framework of the friendly settlement proceedings in the case of Gamrekelashvili v. Georgia ((dec.) no. 6439/10, 6 September 2011).24. In reply, the applicant reiterated his general allegations about poor conditions of sanitation and hygiene, lack of outdoor exercise, and the diet, without providing any concrete details.25. As regards the medical complaint, the applicant claimed that the administrative-law remedy proposed by the Government was completely ineffective, as it involved extremely time-consuming and inefficient court proceedings. He did not comment on the adequacy of the compensatory remedies suggested by the Government.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Conditions of detention26. The Court notes that information about conditions of detention falls within the knowledge of the domestic authorities. Accordingly, applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Still, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide – to the greatest possible extent – some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no. 32362/02, § 45, 20 May 2010, and Ukhan v. Ukraine, no. 30628/02, § 65, 18 December 2008).27. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the applicant’s allegations were formulated as vague and general statements (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above). While it is aware of the fact that poor conditions of detention constituted a general structural problem in the penal sector in Georgia at the material time (see, amongst others, Janiashvili v. Georgia, no. 35887/05, § 70, 27 November 2012) the Court cannot ignore the simple fact that the applicant failed to provide a detailed account concerning the conditions in which he was held (see, for example, Visloguzov, cited above, §§ 48-49, and Ukhan, cited above, § 65). In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that this part of the application has not been properly substantiated by the applicant (see Shkurenko v. Russia (dec.) no. 15010/04, 10 September 2009). Therefore, it should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.(b) Infection with TB28. As to the alleged infection with TB in prison, the applicant in the current case has never attempted to bring a civil claim for damages for his alleged infection. The Court notes, however, that it has previously examined a similar situation and found that a civil claim for damages under Article 207 of the General Administrative Code and Article 413 of the Civil Code was the most effective remedy to be used (see Goloshvili v. Georgia, no. 45566/08, §§ 24-25 and 32-33, 23 October 2012; see also Jeladze, cited above, § 35). The Court sees no reason to depart from its previous conclusion and considers that this aspect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.(c) Medical treatment29. As to the alleged absence of adequate medical care in prison, the Court reiterates that prior to 1 October 2010, the Georgian law and practice did not provide for an effective legal remedy allowing a claimant to obtain injunctive relief in a situation concerning lack of medical care in prison. Consequently, it was sufficient for an ill detainee, who wished to complain to the Court of a lack of adequate medical care, to have alerted the relevant domestic authorities about his or her state of health (see Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 51-54 and 57; Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above, §§ 53‑55; Goloshvili, cited above, §§ 34-35, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 31-33). In view of the relevant circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the prison authorities were made sufficiently aware of the applicant’s medical situation and had an opportunity to offer redress (see paragraphs 11-14 above). Consequently, having regard to the above case‑law on the subject matter, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion.30. The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment in prison is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. Submissions by the parties31. The Government firstly submitted that the positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention did not encompass an obligation on States to conduct compulsory screening for the presence of tuberculosis. They claimed in this connection that the first time the applicant had voiced his grievances concerning possible infection with TB was in January 2010, and by February 2010 he had been provided with all the required medical examinations and treatment. Hence, the examination for TB was not belated.32. With respect to the anti-tuberculosis treatment itself, the Government argued, relying on the relevant medical reports, that the applicant had been provided with the necessary medical assistance without interruption since his diagnosis was revealed. At the initial stage he had been administered with comprehensive in-patient treatment in the prison hospital and Ksani prison, which had included the relevant tests, repeated consultations with medical specialists, the necessary medication, and so on. Subsequently, the applicant had been transferred to Rustavi no. 1 Prison. The Government explained that this had become possible only after a significant improvement in the applicant’s medical condition. They dismissed the applicant’s allegation according to which Rustavi no. 1 Prison was not capable of providing him with adequate medical care. The Government submitted in this connection a letter dated 18 August 2010 from the Ministry of Prisons, according to which the DOTS programme, which allows for the provision of the relevant anti-tuberculosis drugs to infected prisoners, has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 prison since 10 June 2010.33. The Government also claimed with respect to his other diseases that the applicant had been provided with the requisite medical treatment from the very beginning of his detention. In support, they submitted, as regards the treatment allegedly available in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a letter of the prison Governor dated 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 13 above) and an unnamed and undated one-page extract from a medical file, according to which Finlepsin had been provided to the applicant for his epilepsy. As regards the post-February 2010 period, the Government submitted a copy of the applicant’s full medical file. The relevant excerpts showed, according to the Government, that the applicant had been provided with adequate drug‑based treatment for his epilepsy, chronic bronchitis and other minor ailments. The applicant’s diagnosis of circulatory dystonia had not been confirmed.34. In reply, the applicant reiterated his complaint that the treatment dispensed to him in prison had been inadequate. Notably, he noted that firstly his medical examination, despite repeated medical complaints, had been conducted with substantial delay, which had had a detrimental effect on his medical condition; moreover, his eight-month anti-TB treatment course in Ksani no. 8 Prison had suddenly been interrupted by his unjustified transfer on 23 July 2010 to Rustavi no. 1 Prison, which had not been properly equipped to treat him. Lastly, the applicant vaguely claimed that he had not been treated for the rest of his diseases.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles35. The relevant general principles concerning the adequacy of medical treatment in prisons have been summarised by the Court in the cases of Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 69-70, Jeladze, cited above, §§ 41-42, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 39-40.(b) Application of the principles to the present case36. The Court considers that the applicant’s current complaint could be divided into two periods, before and after the applicant’s diagnosis with TB in February 2010.(i) Before February 201037. The Court notes that the applicant was arrested on 4 October 2007 and put immediately in pre-trial detention. In November 2008 he was diagnosed with, inter alia, chronic bronchitis.38. At this point, the Court would first address the Government’s argument concerning the timing of the applicant’s TB test (see paragraph 31 above). The gravity of the problem of tuberculosis in the Georgian prisons, as well as the role of the above-mentioned screening in minimising the spread of this disease, was already acknowledged by the Court in its case‑law on the matter (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, §§ 103‑105, 3 March 2009; see also, Poghosyan, cited above, § 69, and, mutatis mutandis, Jeladze, cited above, § 44). In the present case the applicant did not have a screening test for tuberculosis during the initial two and a half years of his detention. Even after his diagnosis with chronic bronchitis, his requests for medical assistance were left unnoticed (see paragraphs 11-14 above). The Court finds this negligence on the part of the relevant prison authorities to be incompatible with the general obligation to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis and other contagious diseases in prisons (see Jeladze, cited above, § 44, with further references therein).39. On a more general note, the Court observes that the Government failed to submit any medical evidence concerning the applicant’s medical condition during the initial period of his detention, or the treatment administered to him during that time (see, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, § 70, cited above). Neither the letter of the prison Governor nor the undated one-page extract from a medical file (see paragraphs 13 and 33 above) can serve as a sufficient proof in this case (see Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 42-45).40. That being so, the Government, in the Court’s opinion, have failed in accounting for the detained applicant’s state of health and thus in discharging their part of the burden of proof (see, Jeladze, cited above, § 45 and, Irakli Mindadze, cited above, § 47; see also, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, cited above, § 75). The Court, hence, considers that until February 2010 the applicant was left without appropriate medical care in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.(ii) After February 201041. Turning now to the post-diagnosis period, the Court notes that in early February 2010 the applicant was diagnosed with smear-positive focal pulmonary TB at the stage of infiltration. He was immediately placed on the DOTS programme and started receiving all the required first-line anti‑tuberculosis agents on the premises of Ksani no. 8 Prison. On 21 May 2010 the applicant underwent a bacteriological sputum test which was smear-negative. Subsequently, on 23 July 2010, he was transferred to the medical unit of Rustavi no. 1 Prison, where he began the second phase of his anti-TB treatment.42. The Court notes that the applicant’s transfer to a normal prison took place only after the first-phase anti-tuberculosis treatment had yielded positive results (see paragraphs 18 and 32 above). It further observes, on the basis of the relevant medical evidence, that the applicant’s eight-month treatment was not interrupted but rather continued at Rustavi no. 1 Prison (see paragraph 32 above). Hence, the only issue pending before the Court is to assess whether Rustavi no. 1 Prison was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with the second-phase anti-TB treatment.43. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the DOTS programme has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 Prison since 10 June 2010, whilst the applicant was transferred to that prison on 23 July 2010; secondly, according to the available medical evidence, the applicant has continued to receive second-phase anti-TB drugs in line with the DOTS standards; thirdly, the available medical evidence reveals that the applicant has been under permanent medical supervision since his transfer to Rustavi no.1 Prison, with periodic medical check-ups conducted in the prison hospital. Lastly, the latest bacteriological sputum tests performed on the applicant confirmed the smear-negative results.44. Against this background the Court finds the applicant’s argument concerning the inadequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment administered to him in Rustavi no. 1 Prison unsubstantiated. Whilst acknowledging that there may be advantages to anti-tuberculosis treatment provided on an in‑patient basis, the Court nevertheless concludes, having duly examined the applicant’s medical file, that there are not sufficient grounds for questioning the adequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment provided to the applicant following his diagnosis of February 2010.45. As regards the applicant’s other diseases, the Government submitted his full medical file, from which it appears that he has been placed under permanent medical supervision as far as the period after February 2010 concerns; the applicant’s epilepsy has been under control, as no epileptic seizures have been recorded and he has been provided with the required drug-based treatment for this and other of his medical conditions. The applicant failed to point to any specific inadequacies in this area.46. In view of the above, the Court finds no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to be applicant following his diagnosis of tuberculosis in February 2010.47. In the light of the conclusions reached above (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above), the Court does not consider that it is also necessary to consider this complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION48. The applicant alleged, relying on Article 3 of the Convention, that he had been beaten by unidentified prison officers on an unspecified date in Gldani no. 8 prison. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he also challenged the outcome of the criminal proceedings conducted against him. He maintained, inter alia, that the domestic courts had improperly assessed the circumstances of his case and that, instead of endorsing the incriminating evidence, the courts should have subscribed to his arguments in defence. Invoking Article 13 of the Convention, in conjunction with the above-mentioned provision, the applicant also complained that an application to the Supreme Court was not an effective judicial remedy, as that court had rejected his cassation appeal as inadmissible.49. In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage51. The applicant claimed 950 euros (EUR) in respect of expenses his family had incurred in supporting him in prison and EUR 23 for medicines he had purchased. In addition, he claimed EUR 4,250 in compensation for the expenses his family would have to incur to support him in prison for the remaining seventeen years of his imprisonment. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed EUR 45,000.52. The Government contested these claims, stating that they were groundless.53. The Court rejects as unsubstantiated the costs borne for the medicines. As regards the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged in connection with the applicant’s past and future living expenses in prison; it therefore rejects that claim. However, having regard to its conclusions under Article 3 of the Convention, and making its own assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,500 for non-pecuniary damage.B. Costs and expenses54. The applicant claimed, on the basis of two bank statements, EUR 166 in respect of his representation before the domestic court. He also claimed a total of EUR 66 for postal expenses, without submitting any relevant bills in support.55. The Government argued that this claim was unsubstantiated.56. In the light of its well-established case-law on the matter (see, for instance, Ghavtadze, cited above, §§ 118 and 120 and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, § 164, 27 May 2010), and having due regard to the insufficient documentary evidence in its possession, the Court rejects this claim.C. Default interest57. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY1. Declares the complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention concerning the alleged absence of adequate medical treatment for the applicant in prison and the lack of effective remedies in this regard admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inadequate medical treatment provided to the applicant in prison until February 2010;3. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to the applicant after February 2010;4. Holds that it is not necessary to consider the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;5. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,500 (four thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 23 April 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Santiago Quesada Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2013-04-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-118646', 'appno': '65391/09', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'GEO', 'extractedappno': '65391/09;47729/08;35254/07;1871/08;6439/10;32362/02;30628/02;35887/05;15010/04;45566/08;23204/07;18768/05', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;90;193', 'doc_id': '53d0f9b1-3e7d-44ce-bbbf-2d978647eac5'}, page_content='Jeladze v.

       "[(Document(metadata={'Word Count': 2319, 'The Law': '...I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION77. The applicants contended that the police operation at their home had subjected them to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, which provides:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”78. The applicants complained in particular that the manner in which the police operation had been conducted – before daybreak, by masked and heavily armed police officers who had forced their way in and pointed their weapons at them and had handcuffed Mr Gutsanov while forcing him to kneel down – had subjected them to a severe psychological ordeal amounting to degrading treatment.79. In their written observations of 6 January 2012, the applicants complained of the lack of a criminal investigation into their alleged ill‑treatment during the police operation of 31 March 2010.A. Admissibility1. Complaint concerning the police operation of 31 March 2010(a) The Government’s observations80. The Government submitted that this complaint should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and failure to comply with the six‑month time-limit, and because it was premature and the applicants did not have victim status.81. They observed firstly that the criminal investigation against Mr Gutsanov was still pending, with the result that the complaint under Article 3 was premature.82. In the Government’s view, the applicants had not raised their complaint alleging degrading treatment before the competent authorities. Furthermore, they had not lodged an action for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. They had therefore omitted to exhaust the remedies that were normally available and effective under domestic law.83. The Government went on to observe that, in an order of 7 April 2010, the Varna regional public prosecutor’s office had decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers who had entered the applicants’ home. The prosecuting authorities had noted, inter alia, that the police officers’ actions had not constituted any criminal offence. They further argued that the actions in question had in no sense been intended to undermine the applicants’ dignity or cause them any psychological harm; accordingly, they did not amount to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. In the Government’s view, the applicants could not therefore claim to be victims of a violation of their rights under that Article.(b) The applicants’ observations84. The applicants did not dispute the fact that they had not lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had entered their home on 31 March 2010. However, they argued that such a remedy would be manifestly ineffective for two reasons in particular. Firstly, no provision of Bulgarian criminal law made it a punishable offence to inflict degrading treatment on others stemming from psychological pressure. Secondly, as the Court had found in a series of cases concerning operations by special officers of the national police force, the authorities’ systematic refusal to reveal the identity of the officers concerned would make any criminal investigation concerning them ineffective.85. The decision not to prosecute issued by the regional public prosecutor’s office in the present case merely confirmed that a criminal complaint would have been ineffective. The public prosecutor had taken the decision not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers shortly after the file had been opened, on the sole basis of two reports by police officers and without having taken statements from any other witnesses or gathered other evidence. The applicants had not been informed of that decision and had been deprived of any opportunity of being involved in the investigation.86. As to a possible action for damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act, the applicants maintained that this could likewise not be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in their case. According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, section 1 of the Act, under the terms of which the State could be held liable for damage caused as a result of administrative action, was not applicable to action taken by police officers to enforce investigative measures in the context of criminal proceedings, which formed part of the judicial process rather than the performance of administrative duties. Furthermore, in a binding interpretative judgment delivered in 2005, the Supreme Court of Cassation had made clear that where administrative bodies including the police were implementing measures ordered by the judicial authorities, an action for damages against the State could be brought only against the latter and on the basis of section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. However, section 2 provided for compensation in only a limited number of situations. The only one that could possibly apply in the present case was Mr Gutsanov’s acquittal or the subsequent discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him. However, it would be difficult for the applicants to prove their allegations given that all the witnesses to the events were police officers who had taken part in the operation of 31 March 2010.(c) The Court’s assessment87. The Court observes at the outset that the Government raised several objections of inadmissibility in relation to the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of the parties’ submissions, it considers that the issues of compliance with the six-month time-limit and the allegedly premature nature of the application are closely linked to the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government. It therefore considers it appropriate first of all to determine whether the applicants in the present case complied with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies.(i) Objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies88. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to have exhausted the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among many other authorities, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 81, ECHR 2000‑VII, and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000‑VII).89. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once that has been demonstrated, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑IV).90. According to the Court’s established case-law, the remedy normally available in Bulgarian law in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment allegedly caused by police officers is a complaint to the prosecuting authorities (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 86, Reports 1998‑VIII; Osman and Osman v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 43233/98, 6 May 2004; and Kemerov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004). The applicants in the present case did not lodge such a complaint with the public prosecutor against the police officers who entered their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They contended in that regard that a complaint to the prosecuting authorities could not be regarded as an effective remedy in their case, in view of the nature of the ill-treatment to which they had been subjected and the deficiency of the domestic criminal-law provisions (see paragraph 84 above).91. The Court observes that in its judgment in Hristovi v. Bulgaria (no. 42697/05, § 95, 11 October 2011), it noted with concern the treatment accorded in Bulgarian criminal law to acts causing psychological suffering. It noted in particular that, with the exception of the very specific case of death threats, the Bulgarian Criminal Code did not provide for the criminalisation of acts by police officers giving rise to this kind of suffering, resulting, for example, from an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. Hence, unless a complainant alleged that he or she had sustained physical injury at the hands of the police, the authorities could not be required to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the acts complained of. The Court noted that this deficiency in the criminal law allowed those responsible for inflicting psychological trauma to escape criminal accountability for their actions.92. The applicants in the present case complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of the police operation carried out at their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They did not claim to have been physically assaulted by the police officers. It therefore appears that if they had lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers in question, the prosecuting authorities would have inevitably refused to institute criminal proceedings because of the same legal deficiency observed by the Court in Hristovi (cited above). It follows that the criminal-law remedy that was normally available and effective in cases of physical violence inflicted by the police was bound from the outset to fail in the particular circumstances complained of by the applicants. The Court cannot therefore criticise them for not having lodged a complaint with the prosecuting authorities against the officers involved in the police operation.93. The Court further observes that in its judgment in Mirosław Garlicki v. Poland (no. 36921/07, § 77, 14 June 2011), it acknowledged that the civil claim for compensation provided for by Polish law in cases of violations of personal rights such as the right to health, liberty, honour and human dignity constituted appropriate redress in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, in a case in which the applicant complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of his arrest by masked officers, which had taken place in front of a large number of people and had subsequently received extensive media coverage. It observes that the applicants in the present case also complained of the psychological effects of the police operation targeting them. The Government contended that the applicants could have lodged a claim for compensation under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 82 above). However, the Court considers that, in contrast to the case of Mirosław Garlicki (cited above, §§ 77 and 78), where the applicant had available to him several effective domestic remedies, any action for compensation lodged by the four applicants under section 1 or 2 of the above-mentioned Bulgarian Act would have had no prospect of success, for the reasons outlined below.94. The Court points out in this regard that section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act allows individuals to bring proceedings in tort against the State on account of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions of State authorities or officials in the performance of their administrative duties. According to the settled case-law of the highest courts in Bulgaria, acts performed by the investigating and prosecuting authorities in the context of criminal proceedings do not form part of their administrative duties and thus do not come within the ambit of section 1 of the above-mentioned Act (see paragraph 67 above and Iliya Stefanov, cited above, § 28). The Court observes that the police operation at the applicants’ home was carried out in the context of criminal proceedings and was aimed at arresting Mr Gutsanov and searching his home for evidence. Hence, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the operation formed part of the investigative measures taken in the course of those proceedings and did not engage the State’s liability in tort under section 1 of the above-mentioned Act.95. As regards the applicability of section 2 of the same Act, the Court observes that the only situations that might have been applicable in the circumstances of the case were a finding that Mr Gutsanov’s detention was unlawful and the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him or his acquittal at first instance or on appeal (see paragraph 67 above). However, the Court notes that the courts to which Mr Gutsanov applied for release found his detention to be in accordance with domestic law ... It further notes that, according to the latest information received by the first applicant, the criminal proceedings in question are still pending at the preliminary investigation stage ... In these circumstances, an action under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act as in force at the relevant time would have been bound to fail.96. The Court also notes that any action lodged under section 2 of the above-mentioned Act in the event of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov or his acquittal would not have amounted to express or tacit acknowledgment of the breach of his right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Any such action would have had to establish that the damage in question had occurred as a result of charges being brought for a criminal offence in proceedings which were subsequently discontinued or ended in an acquittal. Accordingly, the examination of the facts by the domestic courts would have been confined to purely formal findings and would not have encompassed the actual substance of the applicants’ complaints, namely what they saw as the unnecessary nature of the methods employed by the police in order to achieve the objective of the operation, and the adverse psychological effects of the law-enforcement operation on the four applicants.97. In sum, the Court considers that, because of the deficiencies in the domestic legislation, neither the criminal complaint nor the action for damages against the State referred to by the Government would have constituted sufficiently effective domestic remedies in the instant case. The criminal remedy would have been bound to fail because of the absence of any provisions in Bulgarian law making it an offence to inflict psychological suffering (see paragraphs 90-92 above), while an action for compensation against the State would have been ineffective because of the limited scope of the domestic courts’ review in the context of such proceedings (see paragraphs 94-96 above). The Government did not refer to any other remedy capable of affording redress to the applicants for the alleged violation of their rights under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of these considerations and of the arguments outlined above, the Court considers that the Government’s rejection of non-exhaustion should be rejected.(ii) Compliance with the other conditions of admissibility98. The Government also maintained that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention had been lodged prematurely as the preliminary investigation concerning Mr Gutsanov was still pending. The Court can discern no direct link between the criminal proceedings to which the Government referred and the applicants’ complaint: the proceedings in question are not designed to establish whether the agents of the State safeguarded the applicants’ physical well-being or dignity, but rather to ascertain whether Mr Gutsanov was guilty of conspiracy and of various other criminal offences linked to his position as chairman of Varna municipal council ...99. Even assuming that the Government expect the criminal proceedings to be discontinued or Mr Gutsanov to be acquitted, which would allow him to lodge a claim for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 95 above), the Court reiterates that an action of this kind could not lead to a finding of a violation of the applicants’ right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment during the police operation at their home (see paragraph 96 above). In view of these considerations, the Court cannot criticise the applicants for having applied to it before the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov were concluded. It follows that the present complaint is not premature and that the Government’s preliminary objection should be rejected.100. The Government also contended that the applicants had not complied with the six-month time-limit laid down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the six-month rule is closely linked to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as the six-month period runs from the date of the decision considered as final for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). Nevertheless, where no adequate remedy is available in domestic law, the six-month period in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place (see Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, § 155, ECHR 2005‑XI).101. In examining the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government, the Court noted that none of the remedies they referred to satisfied the effectiveness requirement under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Thus, in the present case, the start of the six-month period should be the date of the events giving rise to the complaint under Article 3, that is to say 31 March 2010. As the applicants lodged their application on 21 May 2010, the Court notes that the six-month time-limit for lodging an application with it was complied with in the instant case. The objection as to inadmissibility raised in this regard must therefore also be rejected.102. Lastly, the Government disputed the applicants’ victim status, arguing that they had not been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court considers that this objection should be joined to the examination of the merits of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. It notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Complaint concerning the lack of a criminal investigation into the events103. The Court observes that the applicants raised this complaint in their written observations of 6 January 2012. In examining the admissibility of their application under the substantive aspect of Article 3, however, it noted that any criminal complaint seeking the opening of an investigation into the events would be bound to fail from the outset in view of the absence of any provision in domestic law laying down criminal penalties in respect of acts committed by police officers which cause psychological suffering (see paragraph 92 above); this argument was, moreover, advanced by the applicants themselves (see paragraph 84 above).104. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled case-law, the starting-point of the six-month period for lodging an application with it is the date on which the act complained of occurred, where domestic law does not afford appropriate remedies (see paragraph 100 above). It therefore considers that, in the present case, the six-month period for lodging an application under the procedural limb of Article 3 started on 31 March 2010. The applicants formulated their complaint one year and nine months later. It follows that this complaint was submitted out of time and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.B. Merits1. The parties’ submissions(a) The applicants105. The applicants submitted that the manner in which the police operation at their home had been carried out was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. On 31 March 2010, before dawn, a group of masked and heavily armed police officers had forced their way into their house without prior authorisation. The special officers had entered Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi’s bedroom and pointed their weapons at the couple’s two minor daughters. Mr Gutsanov, an influential and respected politician, had been forced to kneel down and been handcuffed.106. In the applicants’ view, there had been no reason for the police operation to be planned and carried out in this manner, in particular as Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi were respectable people who were well known in the city. Neither of them had a criminal record and there had been no reason to suppose that they would offer resistance to the law-enforcement officers. The search of their home did not constitute an urgent investigative measure under Article 161 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the applicants, all these elements pointed to a real intention to intimidate them, undermine their dignity and induce a feeling of powerlessness in the face of the actions of the law-enforcement officers.107. The police officers’ actions had had an adverse psychological impact on the applicants. In particular, Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, aged five and seven, had been subjected to considerable psychological pressure, as noted by the psychiatrists who had examined them shortly after the events in issue. Mr Gutsanov, a respected politician belonging to an opposition political party, had been the victim of a brutal arrest which had been widely covered in the media and which, together with the arrests of other politicians, formed part of a propaganda campaign by the ruling party. The psychological effects of the treatment complained of had been sufficiently severe to exceed the threshold required by Article 3 and for the treatment in question to be characterised as “degrading”.(b) The Government108. The Government contested the applicants’ allegations and their version of events. They submitted that the police operation of 31 March 2010 had been planned meticulously and carried out in a way which respected the applicants’ dignity and their rights. Mr Gutsanov’s arrest and the search of his home had been carried out in the context of a criminal investigation into serious offences involving several suspected accomplices. The police had been informed that Mr Gutsanov kept a gun in his home.109. The police operation had been launched after sunrise, that is to say after 6 a.m. The police had knocked on the gate of the applicants’ property, announced their presence and requested that the metal gate be opened. The security guard had opened the gate but explained that he did not have a key to the front door of the house. The police had run towards the door and knocked on it, demanding that it be opened immediately. Mr Gutsanov had appeared twice at the window of the house; he had seen and identified the police by their uniforms but had not come down to open the door. At that point, fearing that he might destroy evidence, fetch his firearm or try to escape, the special officers had forced open the door of the house. They had apprehended Mr Gutsanov on the second floor while he was trying to enter a bedroom where his wife and two children were.110. According to the Government, Mr Gutsanov had not been forced to kneel down. The officers had placed the handcuffs on him without using special immobilisation techniques and they had not pointed their weapons at his wife and daughters. The only officer who had gone into the bedroom on the second floor had been carrying only an electric stun gun and had not addressed the children or Mrs Gutsanova. The special officers had stayed in the house for only a few minutes and had left the premises after Mr Gutsanov’s arrest. Shortly afterwards, the applicant’s handcuffs had been removed.111. The police officers’ actions had complied with domestic law. The search had been approved by a judge within twenty-four hours of being carried out and the regional public prosecutor’s office, on the basis of the information supplied by the authorities, had found that the police officers had not committed any criminal offence.112. The Government conceded that the entry of the police into their home, and the search of the house, had undoubtedly aroused negative feelings in the applicants. However, they submitted that these were the normal and inevitable consequence of this kind of investigative measure; hence, the unpleasantness caused had not exceeded the threshold of severity beyond which Article 3 of the Convention applied. This was borne out, for instance, by the fact that the elder of the two girls had been taken to school as usual. The Government also maintained that if Mr Gutsanov had opened the front door of the house, the police officers would not have needed to resort to special measures to enter his home, which would have spared the members of his family the unpleasantness they had experienced.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Establishment of the facts113. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention must be supported by appropriate evidence. To establish the facts, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Salman, cited above, § 100).114. The Court notes that the events surrounding the police operation at the home of the four applicants were not the subject of any review by the domestic courts. When faced with similar situations, the Court has carried out its own assessment of the facts while complying with the rules laid down by its own case-law (see, by way of example, Sashov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 14383/03, § 48, 7 January 2010).115. On the basis of these principles, the Court deems it appropriate to take as the starting-point of its analysis the circumstances not disputed between the parties and the evidence adduced by them. It will also take into account those allegations by the parties which are sufficiently corroborated by the undisputed facts and the evidence adduced.116. It is not disputed between the parties that the police operation at the applicants’ home began shortly after 6.30 a.m. on 31 March 2010. The footage from the property’s CCTV cameras made available to the Court, and the weather report from the Varna meteorological service, corroborated the applicants’ allegation that the operation took place before sunrise, mainly around dawn (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).117. The parties also agree that the police operations team was made up of uniformed officers, plain clothes officers and special officers who were armed and masked. The video footage submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 21 above) and the reports submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 27 above) corroborate this.118. The fact that there was a firearm and ammunition in the applicants’ home is also undisputed and is established by the search report. It is clear from the Government’s observations and the reports they submitted that the police officers had been alerted by their superior officers to the presence of the weapon (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above).119. It is also common ground between the parties that the gate to the applicants’ property was opened voluntarily by the security guard at the request of the police officers (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above). Moreover, the scene was filmed and recorded by the property’s CCTV system (see paragraph 21 above). The parties also agree that the security guard informed the police officers of the identity of those present in the house and the fact that he did not have a key to the front door, and that the door was forced by the special officers who entered the house and arrested Mr Gutsanov (see paragraphs 13, 14, 24 and 25 above).120. Neither of the parties disputes the fact that the applicants were not physically injured during the police operation. The certificates attesting to the psychiatric examinations carried out on Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above) were not disputed by the Government.121. The first discrepancy between the parties’ version of events concerns the description of Mr Gutsanov’s conduct. According to the Government, he appeared twice at one of the windows of the house, saw the police officers and heard their calls but did not open the front door (see paragraph 25 above). The first applicant, meanwhile, stated that he had not realised that it was a police operation until the special officers entered the house and began to climb the stairs (see paragraph 16 above).122. The evidence available to the Court does not enable it to determine whether the applicant did actually appear at the window of his house and deliberately refused to open the front door to the police officers. However, it notes that it is not disputed that the police officers knocked at the front gate of the property and announced their presence to the security guard by calling out. According to the police officers, they then knocked on the front door of the house and called out “Police! Open up!”. This assertion is corroborated by the statements made by Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi, according to which they were woken by shouts and knocking at the door of the house (see paragraph 15 above). Mr Gutsanov stated that he had gone down to the first floor of the house to fetch the two children before going back up to the bedroom on the second floor. This claim was corroborated by the version of the police officers who saw the outline of a man through the windows of the house (see paragraph 25 above).123. As to the exact place in which Mr Gutsanov was arrested, the Court observes that he himself admitted in his statement that when the police officers forced the door and issued verbal warnings, he had run up to the bedroom on the second floor where his wife and children were (see paragraph 16 above). The Court is not in a position to determine whether Mr Gutsanov was arrested inside the bedroom on the second floor of the house, as he claimed, or on the second-floor landing after he had come out of the bedroom of his own volition, as claimed by the Government. Nor has it been established beyond any reasonable doubt that the police officers spoke to Mrs Gutsanova and asked her to cover the children with the duvet. In any event the Court observes that, according to the witness evidence given by the special officers (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), they saw Mr Gutsanov’s wife and children inside the bedroom when they went up to the second floor of the house in pursuit of Mr Gutsanov. The Court accepts that Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters also saw the armed and masked men, if only through the bedroom door.124. In the Court’s view, Mr Gutsanov’s claim that he was forced to kneel down so that the police officers could place the handcuffs on him has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. As regards the handcuffing, it is not disputed that the special officers placed handcuffs on Mr Gutsanov downstairs (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court observes that neither of the parties specified the length of time for which Mr Gutsanov remained in handcuffs. In any event, it cannot but observe that there is no evidence in the file to demonstrate that the first applicant was made to appear in handcuffs before the cameras of the journalists who had gathered outside the entrance to the property that day. Furthermore, the photograph taken as he was leaving the house, at around 1 p.m., shows no signs of him being handcuffed ... Accordingly, the Court considers that the present case falls to be distinguished in that regard from the case of Mirosław Garlicki, (cited above, § 75), in which the applicant was arrested at his workplace in front of his colleagues and patients, placed in handcuffs and filmed.(b) Compliance with Article 3 in the instant case125. The Court reiterates that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000‑IV). Psychological suffering may result from a situation in which State agents deliberately instil fear in individuals by threatening to kill or ill-treat them (see Hristovi, cited above, § 80).126. Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force by police officers during an arrest. Nevertheless, the use of force must be proportionate and absolutely necessary in the circumstances of the case (see, among many other authorities, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 76, ECHR 2000‑XII, and Altay v. Turkey, no. 22279/93, § 54, 22 May 2001). In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 56, Reports 1997‑VIII). The Court reiterates in particular that any recourse by agents of the State to physical force against a person which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, § 59, 28 July 2009). This strict proportionality test has also been applied by the Court in situations where the individuals concerned were already in the hands of the law‑enforcement agencies (see, among other authorities, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269; Rehbock, cited above, §§ 68-78; and Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, §§ 52-65, 24 January 2008).127. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the operation pursued the legitimate aim of carrying out an arrest, a search and a seizure of items as well as the public-interest objective of prosecuting criminal offences. The Court must be satisfied that a fair balance was struck in the circumstances of the case between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. It notes that, although the four applicants were not physically injured in the course of the impugned police operation, the latter necessarily entailed a degree of physical force. The front door of the house was forced open by the special operations team, Mr Gutsanov was immobilised by masked armed officers, led downstairs by force and handcuffed. The Court must therefore establish whether this use of physical force was proportionate and absolutely necessary in the instant case.128. The aim of the police operation at the applicants’ home that day was to arrest Mr Gutsanov, who was a suspect in a criminal case concerning misappropriation of public funds, and to carry out a search of the premises to look for physical and documentary evidence in the context of the same criminal investigation. It emerges from the evidence in the file that the investigation in question had been opened five months previously, that there were several suspects in the case and that the authorities suspected the existence of a conspiracy (see paragraph 9 ... above). The case clearly did not concern a group of individuals suspected of committing violent criminal acts.129. With regard to Mr Gutsanov’s personality, the Court observes that he was a well-known political figure in Varna: at the material time he was Chairman of the city’s municipal council. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the file to suggest that he had a history of violence or that he might have presented a danger to the police officers conducting the operation at his home.130. It is true that Mr Gutsanov was the lawful owner of a firearm and ammunition which he kept at his home. This fact was known to the police and had been specifically mentioned at the briefing of the police team before the operation (see paragraph 23 above). This was undoubtedly a relevant factor which had to be taken into account by the officers during the operation at the applicants’ home. However, the Court considers that the presence of the weapon in the applicants’ home was not sufficient in itself to justify the deployment of a special operations team or the degree of force that was used in the instant case.131. It is clear from the file that the possible presence of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and minor children was not taken into consideration at any stage in planning and carrying out the police operation. The fact was not mentioned during the pre-operation briefing (see paragraph 23 above) and the police officers apparently paid no heed to the warning by the security guard that young children were present in the house (see paragraph 24 above).132. Of course, the Court cannot go so far as to require the law‑enforcement agencies not to arrest persons suspected of criminal offences in their homes whenever their children or spouses are present. However, it considers that the possible presence of family members at the scene of an arrest is a circumstance that must be taken into consideration in planning and carrying out this type of police operation. This was not done in the present case and the law-enforcement agencies did not contemplate any alternative means of carrying out the operation at the applicants’ home, such as staging the operation at a later hour or even deploying a different type of officer in the operation. Consideration of the legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her daughters was especially necessary since the former was not under suspicion of involvement in the criminal offences of which her husband was suspected, and her two daughters were psychologically vulnerable because they were so young (five and seven years of age).133. The Court also observes that the lack of prior judicial review of the necessity and lawfulness of the search left the planning of the operation entirely at the discretion of the police and the criminal investigation bodies and did not enable the rights and legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters to be taken into consideration. In the Court’s view, such prior judicial review, in the specific circumstances of the present case, would have enabled their legitimate interests to be weighed against the public-interest objective of arresting persons suspected of committing a criminal offence.134. As regards the psychological effects of the police operation on the applicants, the Court observes that police operations which entail intervention in the home and the arrest of suspects inevitably arouse negative emotions in the persons targeted. However, in the present case, there is concrete, undisputed evidence that Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters were very severely affected by the events. Mrs Gutsanova consulted a psychiatrist on two occasions complaining of insomnia and acute anxiety and was prescribed tranquillisers (see paragraph 31 above). The two girls were also examined by a psychiatrist who observed that, when recalling the events, they reacted by crying or displaying acute anxiety (see paragraph 30 above). Mrs Gutsanova stated that her younger daughter, B., had started stammering again (see paragraph 28 above). As for S., the couple’s elder daughter, the statements by her aunt and her schoolteacher indicated that she had been deeply affected by the police operation at her home and by her father’s arrest (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also considers that the fact that the police operation took place in the early morning and involved special officers wearing masks, who were seen by Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, served to heighten the feelings of fear and anxiety experienced by these three applicants, to the extent that the treatment to which they were subjected exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 of the Convention to apply. The Court therefore considers that these three applicants were subjected to degrading treatment.135. As regards the adverse psychological effects of the police operation on Mr Gutsanov, the Court cannot but observe that the first applicant did not produce any medical evidence to this effect. Nevertheless, he stated that the humiliation and anxiety he had experienced during the heavy-handed operation to arrest him, in front of the members of his family, had been sufficiently intense for Article 3 to apply in his case (see paragraph 107 above).136. The Court reiterates its findings to the effect that the police operation in question was planned and carried out without regard for a number of relevant factors such as the nature of the criminal offences of which Mr Gutsanov was suspected, the fact that he had no history of violence, and the possible presence of his wife and daughters in the family home. All these elements point clearly to the excessive nature of the deployment of special officers and special procedures in order to arrest the first applicant and enable the police to enter his home. The Court considers that, in the light of these circumstances, the manner in which Mr Gutsanov’s arrest was carried out – very early in the morning, by several armed and masked officers who forced their way in through the door of the house, and under the frightened gaze of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and two young daughters – aroused strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness in the first applicant, capable of humiliating and debasing him in his own eyes and in the eyes of his close relatives. The Court considers that the intensity of these feelings exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 to apply. Accordingly, Mr Gutsanov too was subjected to degrading treatment.137. In conclusion, having taken into account all the relevant circumstances in the present case, the Court considers that the police operation at the applicants’ home was not planned and carried out in such a way as to ensure that the means employed were strictly necessary in order to attain the ultimate objectives of arresting a person suspected of committing criminal offences and gathering evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. The four applicants were subjected to a psychological ordeal which aroused in them strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness and which, on account of its adverse effects, amounted to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3. There has therefore been a violation of that provision in the present case....FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Decides to join to the merits the Government’s objection regarding the applicants’ victim status in respect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention;2. Declares, unanimously, the complaints concerning Article 3 admissible ...;3.

The applicant complained that his return to Iraq would involve a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Admissibility20. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been invoked or established. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. The submissions of the parties(a) The applicant21. The applicant claimed that, should he be returned to Baghdad or other parts of Iraq, he would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. He pointed out that the Christian minority was still in a vulnerable position in southern and central Iraq and that the authorities there could not guarantee the safety for Christians.22. The applicant referred to his statements made during the Swedish asylum proceedings. In his view, he had shown that he had been and further risked personal persecution and attacks due to his belonging to the Christian minority. He added that, while he had not been in Iraq since 2007, there was no indication that the threats against him were no longer relevant.23. As regards internal relocation, the applicant submitted that the security situation in the Kurdistan Region had recently deteriorated. He also maintained that a reference person was required in order to settle in that region. He had no family or relatives there, and would thus not be able to present a reference to the Kurdish authorities. Consequently, relocation to the Kurdistan Region was neither possible nor reasonable for him.24. The applicant also mentioned that, while he had been separated from and in conflict with his wife, they had recently reunited (thus, in early 2012) and were planning to live together.(b) The Government25. The Government acknowledged that country-of-origin information showed that the general security situation in the southern and central parts of Iraq was still serious and that Christians was one of the more exposed groups. Furthermore, recent information suggested that professionals such as academics, judges and lawyers, doctors and other medical personnel as well as athletes had been prime targets for various extremist groups. However, the Government maintained that there was no general need of protection for all Christians or for all members of other groups in Iraq and, that, consequently, assessments of protection needs should be made on an individual basis.26. As to the applicant’s personal situation, the Government submitted that the applicant had failed to substantiate that there was a connection between the threats he had received from the Mujahedin and the kidnapping of his son, on the one hand, and the threats and assaults to which his wife had been subjected, on the other. Taking into account also the five years that had passed since the applicant had left Iraq, the Government considered that it had not been established that he would run a personal risk of ill-treatment if returned to Iraq.27. In any event, referring to international reports on Iraq as well as information obtained from the Migration Board, the Government contended that there was an internal flight alternative for the applicant in the three northern governorates of the Kurdistan Region. Allegedly, he would be able to enter without any restrictions or sponsor requirements into this region, which had been identified as the safest and most stable in Iraq, and he would be able to settle there, with access to the same public services as other residents. As to the applicant’s personal circumstances in relation to the possibility to relocate internally, the Government stressed that he is an adult man, born in 1968, and that no information had emerged about his health or any other circumstances that indicated that he was not fit for work. Thus, he would be able to provide for himself, even in an area of Iraq where he lacked a social network.28. The Government further asserted that the Migration Board and the courts had provided the applicant with effective guarantees against arbitrary refoulement and had made thorough assessments, adequately and sufficiently supported by national and international source materials. In the proceedings, the applicant had been given many opportunities to present his case, through interviews conducted by the Board with an interpreter present and by being invited to submit written submissions, at all stages assisted by legal counsel. Moreover, having regard to the expertise held by the migration bodies, the Government maintained that significant weight should be given to their findings.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles29. The Court reiterates that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, for example, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, § 67; Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997‑VI, p. 2264, § 42; and Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006-XII). However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-125, ECHR 2008-...).30. The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assesses the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, § 40).31. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, § 96; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, § 128). It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker’s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007; and Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37913/05, 27 March 2008).32. In cases concerning the expulsion of asylum seekers, the Court does not itself examine the actual asylum applications or verify how the States honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. It must be satisfied, though, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other contracting or non-contracting states, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 119, 17 July 2008).(b) The general situation in Iraq33. The Court notes that a general situation of violence will not normally in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of an expulsion (H.L.R. v. France, cited above, § 41). However, the Court has never excluded the possibility that the general situation of violence in a country of destination may be of a sufficient level of intensity as to entail that any removal to it would necessarily breach Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases of general violence, where there is a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 115).34. While the international reports on Iraq attest to a continued difficult situation, including indiscriminate and deadly attacks by violent groups, discrimination as well as heavy-handed treatment by authorities, it appears that the overall situation is slowly improving. In the case of F.H. v. Sweden (no. 32621/06, § 93, 20 January 2009), the Court, having at its disposal information material upto and including the year 2008, concluded that the general situation in Iraq was not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of a person’s return to that country. Taking into account the international and national reports available today, the Court sees no reason to alter the position taken in this respect four years ago.35. However, the applicant did not only claim that the general situation in Iraq was too unsafe for his return, but also that his status as a member of the Christian minority would put him at real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3.(c) The situation of Christians in Iraq36. In the mentioned case of F.H. v. Sweden, following its conclusion that the general situation in Iraq was not sufficient to preclude all returns to the country, the Court had occasion to examine the risks facing the applicant on account of his being Christian. It concluded then that he would not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment on the basis of his religious affiliation alone. In so doing, the Court had regard to the occurrence of attacks against Christians, some of them deadly, but found that they had been carried out by individuals rather than organised groups and that the applicant would be able to seek protection from the Iraqi authorities who would be willing and able to help him (§ 97 of the judgment).37. During the subsequent four years, attacks on Christians have continued, including the attack on 31 October 2010 on the Catholic church Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad, claiming more than 50 victims. The available evidence rather suggests that, in comparison with 2008/09, such violence has escalated. While still the great majority of civilians killed in Iraq are Muslims, a high number of attacks have been recorded in recent years which appear to have specifically targeted Christians and been conducted by organised extremist groups. As noted by the UNHCR (see M.Y.H. and Others, § 25) and others, Christians form a vulnerable minority in the southern and central parts of Iraq, either directly because of their faith or because of their perceived wealth or connections with foreign forces and countries or the practice of some of them to sell alcohol. The UK Border Agency concluded in December 2011 that the authorities in these parts of the country were generally unable to protect Christians and other religious minorities (M.Y.H. and Others, § 26).38. The question arises whether the vulnerability of the Christian group and the risks which the individuals face on account of their faith make it impossible to return members of this group to Iraq without violating their rights under Article 3. The Court considers, however, that it need not determine this issue, as there is an internal relocation alternative available to them in the Kurdistan Region. This will be examined in the following.(d) The possibility of relocation to the Kurdistan Region39. The Court reiterates that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight or relocation alternative in their assessment of an individual’s claim that a return to the country of origin would expose him or her to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision. However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of ill‑treatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, § 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).40. The three northern governorates – Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah – forming the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, or KRI, are, according to international sources, a relatively safe area. While there have been incidents of violence and threats, the rights of Christians are generally considered to be respected. As noted by various sources, large numbers of Christians have travelled to the Kurdistan Region and found refuge there.41. As regards the possibility of entering the KRI, some sources state that the border checks are often inconsistent, varying not only from governorate to governorate but also from checkpoint to checkpoint (see the UNHCR Guidelines and the Finnish/Swiss report, which appears to rely heavily on the UNHCR’s conclusions in this respect, M.Y.H. and Others, §§ 30 and 35 respectively). However, the difficulties faced by some at the KRI checkpoints do not seem to be relevant for Christians. This has been noted by, among others, the UNHCR. Rather, members of the Christian group are given preferential treatment as compared to others wishing to enter the Kurdistan Region. As stated by a representative of an international organisation and the head of Asaysih, the KRI general security authority, to investigators of the Danish/UK fact-finding mission, this is because Christians are at particular risk of terrorist attacks in southern and central Iraq and as the Christians are not considered to pose any terrorist threat themselves (at 4.34 and 8.19 of the report, M.Y.H. and Others, § 36).42. Moreover, while Christians may be able to enter the three northern governorates without providing any documentation at all (see Danish/UK report, at 4.34), in any event there does not seem to be any difficulty to obtain identity documents in case old ones have been lost. As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, § 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, § 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI. It appears that the UNHCR is of the same opinion as regards entry, although its statement in the Guidelines directly concerns only the requirements of a tourist (M.Y.H. and Others, § 30). The Finnish/Swiss report states that Christians may be able to nominate senior clerics as sponsors (M.Y.H. and Others, § 35); thus, they do not have to have a personal acquaintance to vouch for them.43. Internal relocation inevitably involves certain hardship. Various sources have attested that people who relocate to the Kurdistan Region may face difficulties, for instance, in finding proper jobs and housing there, not the least if they do not speak Kurdish. Nevertheless, the evidence before the Court suggests that there are jobs available and that settlers have access to health care as well as financial and other support from the UNHCR and local authorities. In any event, there is no indication that the general living conditions in the KRI for a Christian settler would be unreasonable or in any way amount to treatment prohibited by Article 3. Nor is there a real risk of his or her ending up in the other parts of Iraq.44. In conclusion, therefore, the Court considers that relocation to the Kurdistan Region is a viable alternative for a Christian fearing persecution or ill-treatment in other parts of Iraq. The reliance by a Contracting State on such an alternative would thus not, in general, give rise to an issue under Article 3.(e) The particular circumstances of the applicant45. It remains for the Court to determine whether, despite what has been stated above, the personal circumstances of the applicant would make it unreasonable for him to settle in the Kurdistan Region. In this respect, the Court first notes that the applicant’s account was examined by the Migration Board and the Migration Court, which both gave extensive reasons for their decisions that he was not in need of protection in Sweden. The applicant was able to present the arguments he wished with the assistance of legal counsel and language interpretation.46. As regards the suffering which the applicant and his family experienced in Iraq, the Court notes, without underestimating their serious nature, that they all occurred in Baghdad. It has not been shown that he would be at risk in the Kurdistan Region, and the applicant’s misgivings as to the possibility for him to settle there are not supported by the information on the KRI available to the Court.47. The Court notes that the applicant’s wife and daughter have been granted permanent residence permits in Sweden and that the wife was expected to give birth to another child in October 2012. The applicant’s deportation would inevitably separate the applicant from his wife and children, at least temporarily, but the applicant may apply for a residence permit based on family ties upon his return to Iraq. It should further be borne in mind that the applicant has not complained, at any stage of the proceedings in the present case, of a violation of his right to respect for his family life. Should a future request for a residence permit based on family ties be rejected by the Swedish authorities, he is free to submit a new application to the Court under Article 8 of the Convention, supplying the Court with all the information necessary for it to examine whether his right under that provision has been respected.(f) Conclusion48. Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that, although the applicant, as Christian, belongs to a vulnerable minority and irrespective of whether he can be said to face, as a member of that group, a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the southern and central parts of Iraq, he may reasonably relocate to the Kurdistan Region, where he will not face such a risk. Neither the general situation in that region, including that of the Christian minority, nor any of the applicant’s personal circumstances indicate the existence of said risk.Consequently, his deportation to Iraq would not involve a violation of Article 3.II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT49. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.50. It considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see § 4 above) must continue in force until the present judgment becomes final or until the Court takes a further decision in this connection (see operative part).FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Declares unanimously the application admissible;2. Holds by five votes to two that the implementation of the deportation order against the applicant would not give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Decides unanimously to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until such time as the present judgment becomes final or until further order.Done in English, and notified in writing on 27 June 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Claudia Westerdiek Mark Villiger Registrar PresidentIn accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge Power-Forde joined by Judge Zupančič is annexed to this judgment.M.V.C.W.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v. Sweden, I voted against the majority in finding that Article 3 would not be breached in the event that the deportation order made in respect of this applicant were to be executed. My dissent was based on the failure of the majority to test whether the requisite guarantees required by the Court’s case law prior to a deportation based on internal flight options, were established in this case.However, apart from that question of principle in relation to internal flight options, I have serious doubts as to whether the applicant’s deportation would, in any event, be in compliance with Article 3 of the Convention.The applicant is a 45-year-old man from Baghdad who was and is an active member of the Syrian Orthodox church. He lived with his wife and two children in Baghdad. He has had a particularly severe history of suffering during the war in Iraq because of his religious belief. In February 2007 his wife received threatening letters warning her to leave her job teaching Arabic at an Iraqi university. His family was required to go into hiding. His son was abducted and strangled and his remains were dumped on a street. The police authorities were informed but little was done. A similar threat was then made on his daughter’s life. Eventually, the applicant and his family fled to Syria in September 2007 and, thereafter, the applicant went to Sweden to seek asylum.In the meantime, and having regard to the deteriorating situation in Syria, the applicant’s wife returned to Baghdad in 2010 in search of work. She was kidnapped, attacked and raped by a group of men. She finally came to Sweden with her daughter where both of them were granted asylum.Clearly, the applicant and his wife and daughter were separated for some time, not least, as a consequence of the legacy of war in their home country. However, it is equally clear that the applicant has since reunited with his wife and daughter and that they have been living together for some time. A third child has been born of their marriage in October 2012.Having regard to what the applicant has already endured—the loss of his home, the death of his son, the flight of his family, the assaults upon his wife, the fracturing of their relationship and the ultimate reunification of his family—the suffering that would be imposed upon him by separating him, once again, from his family and his newborn child and by forcing him to return to Iraq—would, to my mind, cross the threshold of suffering required by Article 3.I appreciate that the applicant’s claim is not brought under Article 8 of the Convention. I also recognise that the threat under Article 3 must be assessed in terms of future risk. However, when assessing future risk one has to have regard to the individual circumstances of each case and to the level of suffering to which an individual has already been exposed. Such previous experience may be sufficient to break a person’s moral or psychological resistance in the event that he or she is further exposed to additional suffering.To my mind, given what this applicant has already endured it would be inhuman and degrading to separate him once again from his immediate family, which he has finally managed to hold together despite the trauma of war. The additional suffering that this would entail would be sufficient, to my mind, to break his moral and psychological resistance and would extend beyond the level permitted by Article 3 of the Convention.The expulsion of a person on the basis that internal flight relocation is available may, in altogether different circumstances, be compatible with Article 3. However, having regard to the circumstances of this applicant’s case, his expulsion to Iraq would not, in my view. be compatible with that Article of the Convention.It is formalistic in the extreme to expect that the applicant should be forced to leave his wife and children, once again, purely for the purposes of travelling to the Kurdish region so that, from there, he may contact a Swedish Embassy and apply for family reunification.Therefore, both for the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in M.Y.H. and Others v Sweden and on the merits of this case, I consider that the applicant’s removal to Iraq would violate Article 3.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v.

The applicant alleged that if he were returned to Uzbekistan he would run a real risk of being subjected to torture and ill-treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention, which provides as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Submissions by the parties1. The Government32. The Government submitted that in the course of the extradition proceedings the competent Russian authorities had duly examined the applicant’s situation with regard to his return to Uzbekistan, where he would be prosecuted. In the Government’s opinion, the diplomatic assurances given by the Uzbek authorities were sufficient and compatible with the relevant provisions of international law.33. The Government further submitted that the applicant’s allegations about the risk of ill-treatment in the event of execution of the expulsion order of 18 October 2013 were speculative and “could not be considered by the [domestic] court during the administrative proceedings”. Nevertheless, they had been thoroughly reviewed and found to be unsubstantiated by the Moscow City Court. In any event, the expulsion order did not specify that the applicant was to be expelled to Uzbekistan, but merely stated that he was to be removed from the territory of the Russian Federation. The Government concluded that a risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention had not been convincingly established.2. The applicant34. Firstly, the applicant submitted that he had raised the issue of the risk of his being subjected to ill-treatment if returned to Uzbekistan in the extradition, expulsion and refugee-status proceedings, advancing a number of specific arguments, such as an increased risk of ill-treatment of persons who, like the applicant, were accused of participation in a banned religious activity and those who were suspected of crimes against State security, as had been reliably demonstrated by the international organisations’ reports on the situation in Uzbekistan and the Court’s judgments regarding that matter. However, the Russian courts had failed to analyse the nature of the charges against the applicant, had disregarded the link between the charges and the risk of ill-treatment and had not examined the information from various international organisations or the Court’s case-law.35. As to the Russian Government’s reliance on the diplomatic assurances provided by Uzbekistan in the context of the extradition proceedings, the applicant considered them to be insufficient. He referred, in particular, to Abdulkhakov v. Russia, no. 14743/11, §§ 149-50, 2 October 2012, in this connection.36. Lastly, the applicant contested the Government’s argument that the decision on administrative removal did not necessarily mean that he would be expelled to Uzbekistan. He stated that the expulsion proceedings had been initiated by the Moscow deputy prosecutor’s request of 17 October 2013 which mentioned “the date of his actual handing over to the competent authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan”, and that no other possibility had ever been discussed in the course of those proceedings. The applicant further submitted that there existed an administrative practice of substituting expulsion for extradition which was based on an unpublished order of the Moscow Region prosecutor, no. 86/81 of 3 July 2009, which provided that whenever a detained individual was released on the grounds that his extradition was impossible, it was mandatory to decide on his administrative expulsion from Russia. The applicant therefore maintained that his expulsion had been ordered to secure his rendition to the Uzbekistani authorities and thus to prevent him from being released and to secure either his expulsion or his extradition.B. The Court’s assessment1. Admissibility37. The Court observes firstly that as Uzbekistan’s extradition request is pending before the competent Russian authorities, it is only called upon to examine the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention in relation to the expulsion proceedings.38. The Court notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Merits39. The Court will examine the merits of the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 in the light of the applicable general principles set out in, among others, Umirov v. Russia (no. 17455/11, §§ 92-100, 18 September 2012, with further references).40. In the recent cases against the Russian Federation examined under Article 3 concerning the extradition of applicants to Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, the Court has identified the critical elements to be subjected to searching scrutiny (see, among many other authorities, Savriddin Dzhurayev v. Russia, no. 71386/10, ECHR 2013 (extracts); Kasymakhunov v. Russia, no. 29604/12, 14 November 2013; Abdulkhakov v. Russia, cited above; and Iskandarov v. Russia, no. 17185/05, 23 September 2010). Consideration must first be given to whether an applicant has provided the national authorities with substantial grounds for believing that he faces a real risk of ill‑treatment in the destination country. Secondly, the Court will examine whether the claim was adequately assessed by the competent national authorities, discharging their procedural obligations under Article 3 of the Convention, and whether their conclusions were sufficiently supported by relevant material. Lastly, having regard to all the substantive aspects of a case and the available relevant information, the Court will assess the existence of a real risk of suffering torture or treatment incompatible with the Convention standards.(a) Existence of substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faced a real risk of ill-treatment41. At the outset, the Court reiterates that for more than a decade the United Nations human rights bodies and relevant agencies and international non-governmental organisations have issued alarming reports concerning the situation in the criminal justice system in Uzbekistan, the use of torture and ill‑treatment techniques by law-enforcement agencies, severe conditions in detention facilities, systemic persecution of political opposition, and harsh treatment of certain religious groups.42. The Court has previously had the task of examining many cases concerning the forced return from Russia to Uzbekistan of persons accused by the Uzbek authorities of criminal, religious and political activities (see, most recently, Egamberdiyev cited above; Akram Karimov v. Russia, no. 62892/12, 28 May 2014; and Nizamov and Others v. Russia, nos. 22636/13, 24034/13, 24334/13 and 24528/13, 7 May 2014, with further references). It has been the Court’s constant position that individuals whose extradition was sought by the Uzbek authorities on charges of religiously or politically motivated crimes constituted a vulnerable group, running a real risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention in the event of their transfer to Uzbekistan.43. In the present case, the applicant consistently and specifically argued – in the extradition, expulsion and refugee-status proceedings – that he had been prosecuted for religious extremism and crimes against the State and therefore was a member of the above-mentioned vulnerable group. This was borne out by the extradition documents which were produced by the requesting Uzbekistani authority. The basis for the arrest warrant and extradition request submitted by the Uzbek authorities was clear: the applicant was wanted for prosecution in Uzbekistan on charges of religious and political extremism. These allegations regarding his criminal conduct and its nature remained unchanged throughout the relevant proceedings in the Russian Federation.44. This fact alone, taken in the context of the international reports regarding the systemic ill-treatment of those accused of religious and political crimes, was sufficient to place the applicant definitively within the group of individuals at a severe risk of ill-treatment in the event of their removal to Uzbekistan.45. In the light of the above considerations, the Court is satisfied that the Russian authorities had before them a sufficiently corroborated claim that the applicant faced a real risk of ill-treatment if returned to Uzbekistan.(b) Duty to assess adequately claims of a real risk of ill-treatment relying on sufficient relevant material46. The Court will next examine whether the Russian authorities discharged their obligation to undertake an adequate assessment of the applicant’s claim that he risked being subjected to ill-treatment in the event of his return.47. As regards the refugee-status proceedings, the Court observes that the decisions by the immigration authorities and the courts appear to give preponderant weight to the fact that the applicant had waited for too long before applying for refugee status, and that he had failed to substantiate his claim that he risked political or religious persecution. On the first point the Court reiterates that, whilst a person’s failure to seek asylum immediately after arrival in another country may be relevant for the assessment of the credibility of his or her allegations, the domestic authorities’ findings as regards the failure to apply for refugee status in due time do not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention (see Ermakov v. Russia, no. 43165/10, § 196, 7 November 2013). On the second point, the Court emphasises that the criteria laid down for granting refugee status are not identical to those that are used for assessing the risk of treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. The applicant made detailed submissions about the risk of being subjected to ill-treatment if he were returned to his home country, relying on information from various international organisations and on the judgments of this Court. However, the domestic decisions only mentioned those submissions in passing and did not analyse them in any detail.48. As to the proceedings concerning the applicant’s administrative expulsion, the Court notes that the scope of the review by the domestic courts was largely confined to establishing the fact that the applicant’s presence in Russia had been illegal. In this connection the Court reiterates that, in view of the absolute nature of Article 3, it is not possible to weigh the risk of ill-treatment against the reasons put forward for the expulsion (see Abdolkhani and Karimnia v. Turkey, no. 30471/08, § 91, 22 September 2009). Therefore, the domestic courts’ findings as regards the applicant’s failure to abide by Russian laws do not, as such, refute his allegations under Article 3 of the Convention.49. Having regard to the foregoing, the Court is not persuaded that the applicant’s allegations that he risked ill-treatment were duly examined by the domestic authorities. It must, accordingly, assess whether there exists a real risk that the applicant would be subjected to treatment proscribed by Article 3 if he were to be removed to Uzbekistan.(c) Existence of a real risk of ill-treatment50. The Court notes that the Government pointed out in their observations that the decision on the applicant’s expulsion did not specify that he was to be expelled to Uzbekistan, but merely stated that he was to be removed from the territory of Russia. However, they did not provide information regarding any other country willing to accept him. The Court observes, moreover, that the expulsion proceedings were initiated by the prosecutor’s request directly referring to the “date of [the applicant’s] actual handing over to the competent authorities of the Republic of Uzbekistan” (see paragraph 17 above). In such circumstances, the Court cannot but accept the applicant’s argument that no possibility of his expulsion to another country was discussed in the course of the expulsion proceedings. Accordingly, it concludes that the decision on the applicant’s administrative removal presupposed that he would be expelled to Uzbekistan.51. The Court has had occasion to deal with a number of cases raising the issue of a risk of ill-treatment in the event of extradition or expulsion to Uzbekistan from Russia or another Council of Europe member State. It has found, with reference to material from various sources, that the general situation with regard to human rights in Uzbekistan is alarming, that reliable international material has demonstrated the persistence of a serious issue of ill-treatment of detainees, the practice of torture against those in police custody being described as “systematic” and “indiscriminate”, and that there is no concrete evidence to demonstrate any fundamental improvement in that area (see Egamberdiyev, Akram Karimov, Kasymakhunov, Ermakov, Umirov, all cited above; see also Garayev v. Azerbaijan, no. 53688/08, § 71, 10 June 2010; Muminov v. Russia, no. 42502/06, §§ 93-96, 11 December 2008; and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, no. 2947/06, § 121, 24 April 2008).52. As regards the applicant’s personal situation, the Court notes that he was wanted by the Uzbek authorities on charges related to his alleged membership of a Muslim extremist movement and threats to State security. Those charges constituted the basis for the extradition request and the arrest warrant issued in respect of the applicant. Thus, his situation is no different from that of other Muslims who, on account of practising their religion outside official institutions and guidelines, are charged with religious extremism or membership of banned religious organisations and, on that account, as noted in the reports and the Court’s judgments cited above, are at an increased risk of ill-treatment (see, in particular, Ermakov, cited above, § 203).53. The Court is bound to observe that the existence of domestic laws and international treaties guaranteeing respect for fundamental rights is not in itself sufficient to ensure adequate protection against the risk of ill-treatment where, as in the present case, reliable sources have reported practices resorted to or tolerated by the authorities that are manifestly contrary to the principles of the Convention (see Hirsi Jamaa and Others v. Italy [GC], no. 27765/09, § 128, ECHR 2012). It has also been the Court’s established position that the diplomatic assurances are likewise incapable, on their own, to prevent the risk of ill-treatment from materialising and that the national authorities need to treat with caution the assurances against torture given by a State where torture is endemic or persistent (see Yuldashev v. Russia, no. 1248/09, § 85, 8 July 2010, with further references). Furthermore, the domestic authorities, as well as the Government in their submissions before the Court, used summary and non-specific reasoning in an attempt to dispel the allegations of a risk of ill-treatment on account of the above considerations.54. In view of the above, the Court considers that substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the applicant would face a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention if deported to Uzbekistan.55. The Court therefore concludes that the enforcement of the expulsion order against the applicant would give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention.II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION, TAKEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH ARTICLE 356. The applicant contended under Article 13 of the Convention that no effective remedies were available to him in respect of his allegations of possible ill-treatment in the event of his return to Uzbekistan. Article 13 reads as follows:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”57. The Court considers that the gist of the applicant’s claim under Article 13, which it finds admissible, is that the domestic authorities failed to carry out a rigorous scrutiny of the risk of ill-treatment that the applicant would face in the event of his forced removal to Uzbekistan. The Court has already examined that submission in the context of Article 3 of the Convention. Having regard to its findings above, the Court considers that there is no need to examine this complaint separately on its merits (see, for a similar approach, Gaforov v. Russia, no. 25404/09, § 144, 21 October 2010; Azimov v. Russia, no. 67474/11, § 145, 18 April 2013; and, most recently, Akram Karimov, cited above, § 137).III. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE CONVENTION58. The applicant complained that his detention pending expulsion after 17 October 2013 had been in breach of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention. He further complained, under Article 5 § 4 of the Convention, that he had been unable to obtain a judicial review of that detention. The relevant parts of Article 5 provide as follows:“1. Everyone has the right to liberty and security of person. No one shall be deprived of his liberty save in the following cases and in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law:...(f) the lawful arrest or detention of a person to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition....4. Everyone who is deprived of his liberty by arrest or detention shall be entitled to take proceedings by which the lawfulness of his detention shall be decided speedily by a court and his release ordered if the detention is not lawful. ...”A. Admissibility59. The Court notes that this part of the application is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits60. The Court will consider firstly whether there existed a possibility of effective supervision of the applicant’s detention and secondly whether the applicant’s detention was compatible with the requirements of Article 5 § 1 (f) (see Kim v. Russia, no. 44260/13, § 38, 17 July 2014, and Azimov, cited above, § 146 et seq.)1. Compliance with Article 5 § 4 of the Convention61. The Government submitted that the applicant had been able to take part in all the hearings concerning his detention and to put forward his arguments about alleged violations of Article 5 of the Convention.62. The applicant emphasised that both the Zyuzinskiy District Court and the Moscow City Court had failed to consider his arguments relating to Article 5 of the Convention and that no time-limit for his detention had been stipulated in the expulsion order. With reference to the Court’s previous findings (in particular, in the case of Azimov, cited above, §§ 153‑54), he maintained that Russian law did not provide for a periodic review of the lawfulness of detention following a decision on administrative expulsion.63. The Court reiterates that the purpose of Article 5 § 4 is to guarantee to persons who are arrested and detained the right to judicial supervision of the lawfulness of the measure to which they are thereby subjected. A remedy must be made available during a person’s detention to allow that person to obtain speedy judicial review of its lawfulness. That review should be capable of leading, where appropriate, to release. The existence of the remedy required by Article 5 § 4 must be sufficiently certain, not only in theory but also in practice, failing which it will lack the accessibility and effectiveness required for the purposes of that provision (see Muminov, cited above, § 113, and Ismoilov and Others v. Russia, cited above, § 145, with further references).64. The Court notes at the outset that a judicial review of the kind required under Article 5 § 4 cannot be said to be incorporated in the initial expulsion order of 18 October 2013. The thrust of the applicant’s complaint under Article 5 § 4 was not directed against the initial decision placing him in custody but rather against his inability to obtain a judicial review of his detention after a certain lapse of time. Detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) lasts, as a rule, for a significant period and depends on circumstances which are subject to change over time. Given that since the delivery of the City Court’s appeal judgment of 22 November 2013 the applicant has spent more than a year in custody, new issues affecting the lawfulness of the detention might have arisen during that period. In such circumstances the Court considers that the requirement under Article 5 § 4 was neither incorporated in the initial detention order of 18 October 2013 nor fulfilled by the appeal court (see Rakhimov v. Russia, no. 50552/13, § 147).65. The Court reiterates that, since its Azimov judgment, which concerned a similar complaint (see Azimov, cited above, § 153), it has found a violation of Article 5 § 4 in a number of cases against Russia on account of the absence of any domestic legal provision which could have allowed the applicant to bring proceedings for judicial review of his detention pending expulsion (see Kim, cited above, §§ 39-43; Rakhimov, cited above, §§ 148-150; Akram Karimov, cited above, §§ 199-204; and also Egamberdiyev, cited above, § 64). In the Kim case, the Government acknowledged a violation of Article 5 § 4 and, having regard to the recurrent nature of the violation, the Court directed that the Russian authorities should “secure in [their] domestic legal order a mechanism which allows individuals to institute proceedings for the examination of the lawfulness of their detention pending removal in the light of the developments in the removal proceedings” (see Kim, cited above, § 71).66. As the applicant has not had at his disposal a procedure for a judicial review of the lawfulness of his detention, the Court finds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention.2. Compliance with Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention(a) The parties’ submissions67. The Government submitted that the applicant’s detention pending both extradition and expulsion conformed to the relevant domestic provisions and the guarantees of Article 5 § 1 of the Convention.68. The applicant did not question before the Court the lawfulness of his detention in the extradition proceedings from 17 April to 17 October 2013. As regards the detention imposed in the expulsion proceedings, he admitted that he had violated the immigration rules and failed to register his residence in Russia within the statutory time-limit, but claimed that the authorities had become aware of that fact on 17 April 2013, when he was arrested and found not to have a passport. However, it was not until six months later that the prosecutor instituted expulsion proceedings against him. The applicant claimed that the real purpose of the expulsion proceedings was to keep him under the authorities’ control in order to organise by any means his return to the country which sought his extradition. Other than the requirement that the expulsion order be executed within the two-year time-limit, the Code of Administrative Offences did not contain any provisions governing the length of detention pending expulsion and therefore lacked legal certainty. Moreover, the relevant provisions were open to the interpretation that by the expiry of that two-year time-limit the applicant would again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground. Lastly, the applicant claimed that such a long stay in detention significantly exceeded the maximum custodial sentence permissible under the Code of Administrative Offences and that his detention pending expulsion was of a punitive, rather than preventive, nature.(b) The Court’s assessment69. The Court observes that the applicant’s complaint refers to the period from 18 October 2013 to the present day, in which he has been detained with a view to his administrative removal (“expulsion”) from Russia (see paragraphs 17-20 above). Since administrative removal amounts to a form of “deportation” within the meaning of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention, that provision is applicable in the instant case.70. The Court reiterates that deprivation of liberty under Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention must conform to the substantive and procedural rules of national law. Compliance with national law is not, however, sufficient: Article 5 § 1 requires in addition that any deprivation of liberty should be in keeping with the purpose of protecting the individual from arbitrariness. The notion of “arbitrariness” in Article 5 § 1 extends beyond lack of conformity with national law, so that deprivation of liberty may be lawful in terms of domestic law but still arbitrary, and thus contrary to the Convention. To avoid being branded as arbitrary, detention under Article 5 § 1 (f) must be carried out in good faith; it must be closely connected to the ground of detention relied on by the Government; the place and conditions of detention must be appropriate; and the length of the detention must not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Azimov, cited above, § 161, and Rustamov v. Russia, no. 11209/10, § 150, 3 July 2012, with further references).71. It is common ground between the parties that the applicant had been residing illegally in Russia before his arrest and, therefore, had committed an administrative offence punishable by expulsion. The Court is satisfied that on 18 October 2013 his detention pending expulsion was ordered by a court with jurisdiction in the matter and in connection with an offence punishable by expulsion. On 22 November 2013 the City Court upheld that decision on appeal. The Court accordingly concludes that the authorities acted in compliance with the letter of the national law.72. In so far as the applicant claimed that the real purpose of the expulsion proceedings was to keep him in custody pending the outcome of the extradition proceedings, the Court reiterates that detention may be unlawful if its stated purpose differs from the real one (see Khodorkovskiy v. Russia, no. 5829/04, § 142, 31 May 2011; Čonka v. Belgium, no. 51564/99, § 42, ECHR 2002‑I: and Bozano v. France, 18 December 1986, Series A no. 111, § 60). The Court reiterates that in Azimov it found that a decision ordering the applicant’s detention pending expulsion had served to circumvent the maximum time-limits laid down in the domestic law for detention pending extradition (see Azimov, cited above, § 165). However, it does not need to determine whether the same is true in the instant case because even where the purpose of detention is legitimate, its length should not exceed that reasonably required for the purpose pursued (see Azimov, cited above, § 166, and Shakurov v. Russia, no. 55822/10, § 162, 5 June 2012).73. In the present case, before the authorities ordered the applicant’s detention pending expulsion he had already been in detention with a view to extradition for six months. When deciding to keep the applicant in custody pending expulsion, the courts did not set a specific time-limit for his detention. Under Article 31.9 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences, an expulsion decision must be enforced within two years (see paragraph 27 above). Thus, after the expiry of such a period, a detainee should be released. This may happen in the present case; however, the possible implications of Article 31.9 § 1 of the Code of Administrative Offences for the applicant’s detention are a matter of interpretation, and the rule limiting the duration of detention of an illegal alien is not set out clearly in the law. It is also unclear what will happen after the expiry of the two-year time-limit, since the applicant will clearly remain in an irregular situation in terms of immigration law and will again be liable to expulsion and, consequently, to detention on that ground (see Egamberdiyev, § 62, and Azimov, § 171, both cited above).74. The Court further notes that the maximum penalty in the form of deprivation of liberty for an administrative offence under the Code of Administrative Offences in force is thirty days (see paragraph 28 above), and that detention with a view to expulsion should not be punitive in nature and should be accompanied by appropriate safeguards, as established by the Russian Constitutional Court (see paragraph 29 above). In the present case the “preventive” measure was, paradoxically, much heavier than the “punitive” one (see Azimov, cited above, § 172).75. Lastly, the Court reiterates that there are no provisions of Russian law which could have allowed the applicant to bring proceedings for judicial review of his detention pending expulsion, and no automatic review of his detention at regular intervals (see Azimov, cited above, § 153).76. In view of the above considerations, the Court concludes that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention.IV. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT77. The Court notes that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.78. The Court notes that the applicant is currently detained in Russia and is still formally liable to administrative removal pursuant to the final judgments of the Russian courts in this case. Having regard to the finding that he would face a serious risk of being subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment in Uzbekistan, the Court considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see paragraph 4 above) must remain in force until the present judgment becomes final or until further notice.V. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION79. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage80. The applicant claimed 10,000 euros (EUR) in respect of non-pecuniary damage on account of distress and frustration caused by his detention pending expulsion, as well as on account of anxiety in view of the prospect of being returned to a country where he would be exposed to a risk of ill-treatment.81. The Government pointed out that, in so far as the applicant’s claim concerns the risk of ill-treatment upon return to Uzbekistan, Article 41 of the Convention does not allow for just satisfaction to be awarded for violations that have not yet been committed. Therefore, in their view, no compensation should be awarded to him. As regards the other issues in the present case, the Government considered that the fact of finding a violation would in itself constitute sufficient just satisfaction for any non-pecuniary damage suffered by the applicant.82. The Court observes that no breach of Article 3 of the Convention has yet occurred in the present case. However, it has found that the applicant’s forced return to Uzbekistan would, if implemented, give rise to a violation of that provision. The Court considers that its finding regarding Article 3 amounts in itself to adequate just satisfaction for the purposes of Article 41.83. The Court has found other violations of the Convention in the present case. It accepts that the applicant has suffered non-pecuniary damage which cannot be compensated for solely by the finding of a violation. It therefore awards the applicant EUR 7,500 in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable.B. Costs and expenses84. The applicant also claimed EUR 7,440 for the costs and expenses incurred before the domestic courts and the Court. This included Ms Trenina’s and Ms Ryabinina’s work in representing the applicant in the domestic proceedings and before the Court. According to the table submitted by the applicant, Ms Trenina’s work consisted of forty-nine hours of work at an hourly rate of EUR 120, amounting to EUR 5,880, whereas Ms Ryabinina worked for thirteen hours at the same hourly rate, amounting to EUR 1,560.85. The Government noted that the applicant had provided a breakdown of the work performed by his representatives, but had submitted no agreement concerning legal assistance, or other documents setting out their hourly rates.86. According to the Court’s case-law, an applicant is entitled to the reimbursement of costs and expenses only in so far as it has been shown that these have been actually and necessarily incurred and are reasonable as to quantum. In the present case, regard being had to the documents in its possession and the above criteria, the Court considers it reasonable to award the sum of EUR 5,000, covering costs under all heads plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, and rejects the remainder of the claims under this head.C. Default interest87. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,1. Declares the application admissible;2. Holds that the forced return of the applicant to Uzbekistan would give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Holds that there is no need to examine the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;4. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 4 of the Convention;5. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 5 § 1 (f) of the Convention in respect of the applicant’s detention in the context of the expulsion proceedings;6. Decides to maintain the indication to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court until such time as the present judgment becomes final, or until further notice;7. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months from the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the following amounts, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable at the date of settlement:(i) EUR 7,500 (seven thousand five hundred euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable, in respect of non-pecuniary damage;(ii) EUR 5,000 (five thousand euros), plus any tax that may be chargeable to the applicant, in respect of costs and expenses;(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amounts at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;8. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 26 February 2015, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Søren Nielsen Isabelle Berro Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2015-02-26 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-152601', 'appno': '66373/13', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'RUS', 'extractedappno': '66373/13;34742/13;14743/11;86/81;17455/11;71386/10;29604/12;17185/05;62892/12;22636/13;24034/13;24334/13;24528/13;43165/10;30471/08;53688/08;42502/06;2947/06;27765/09;1248/09;25404/09;67474/11;44260/13;50552/13;11209/10;5829/04;51564/99;55822/10', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Extradition;Expulsion) (Substantive aspect) (Uzbekistan);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-4 - Take proceedings);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-1-f - Expulsion)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;620;618;448;130;481', 'doc_id': 'f7241303-ee51-4fc8-b9e5-30170506772b'}, page_content='Constitution.III.

The applicant complained, under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, of having contracted TB in prison, of insufficient medical care for his various diseases throughout the entire period of his detention, and of having been deprived of effective remedies in this respect. He further challenged the conditions of his detention in Rustavi nos. 1 and 6 Prisons in the periods between 18 July 2008 and 4 March 2010 and 23 July 2010 up to the present as inadequate. Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention read as follows:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A. Admissibility1. The parties’ arguments22. The Government argued that the complaint about poor conditions of detention was unsubstantiated. In support, they submitted two letters from the Governors of the prison facilities involved, describing in detail the conditions of the applicant’s detention. According to these letters, the applicant was being kept in satisfactory conditions; the sanitary and hygienic norms were met; he was allowed to take a shower at least once a week and had been provided with all basic items of hygiene. In Rustavi no. 1 Prison, an open-type prison, the applicant was allowed six hours’ outdoor exercise on a daily basis, whilst in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a closed institution, he had been allowed at least a one-hour walk per day. On the basis of the relevant service provider contracts, the Government further argued that the food available to the applicant in both establishments was prepared in accordance with the legally approved norms, and that the applicant was regularly provided with the basic items of hygiene. In sum, the conditions of the applicant’s detention were compatible with Article 3.23. As regards the applicant’s alleged infection with TB and the inadequacy of the medical treatment provided to him in prison, the Government submitted that these complaints were premature, as the applicant had neither filed, under the relevant administrative rules, complaints of a lack of medical care in prison, nor sought monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage under the relevant provisions of the General Administrative Code and the Civil Code. In support of the latter argument they submitted a case where the domestic authorities had awarded compensation for the death in detention of the plaintiff’s husband, which had been caused by a lack of appropriate medical treatment. This decision was adopted by the domestic court in the framework of the friendly settlement proceedings in the case of Gamrekelashvili v. Georgia ((dec.) no. 6439/10, 6 September 2011).24. In reply, the applicant reiterated his general allegations about poor conditions of sanitation and hygiene, lack of outdoor exercise, and the diet, without providing any concrete details.25. As regards the medical complaint, the applicant claimed that the administrative-law remedy proposed by the Government was completely ineffective, as it involved extremely time-consuming and inefficient court proceedings. He did not comment on the adequacy of the compensatory remedies suggested by the Government.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Conditions of detention26. The Court notes that information about conditions of detention falls within the knowledge of the domestic authorities. Accordingly, applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Still, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide – to the greatest possible extent – some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no. 32362/02, § 45, 20 May 2010, and Ukhan v. Ukraine, no. 30628/02, § 65, 18 December 2008).27. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the applicant’s allegations were formulated as vague and general statements (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above). While it is aware of the fact that poor conditions of detention constituted a general structural problem in the penal sector in Georgia at the material time (see, amongst others, Janiashvili v. Georgia, no. 35887/05, § 70, 27 November 2012) the Court cannot ignore the simple fact that the applicant failed to provide a detailed account concerning the conditions in which he was held (see, for example, Visloguzov, cited above, §§ 48-49, and Ukhan, cited above, § 65). In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that this part of the application has not been properly substantiated by the applicant (see Shkurenko v. Russia (dec.) no. 15010/04, 10 September 2009). Therefore, it should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.(b) Infection with TB28. As to the alleged infection with TB in prison, the applicant in the current case has never attempted to bring a civil claim for damages for his alleged infection. The Court notes, however, that it has previously examined a similar situation and found that a civil claim for damages under Article 207 of the General Administrative Code and Article 413 of the Civil Code was the most effective remedy to be used (see Goloshvili v. Georgia, no. 45566/08, §§ 24-25 and 32-33, 23 October 2012; see also Jeladze, cited above, § 35). The Court sees no reason to depart from its previous conclusion and considers that this aspect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.(c) Medical treatment29. As to the alleged absence of adequate medical care in prison, the Court reiterates that prior to 1 October 2010, the Georgian law and practice did not provide for an effective legal remedy allowing a claimant to obtain injunctive relief in a situation concerning lack of medical care in prison. Consequently, it was sufficient for an ill detainee, who wished to complain to the Court of a lack of adequate medical care, to have alerted the relevant domestic authorities about his or her state of health (see Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 51-54 and 57; Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above, §§ 53‑55; Goloshvili, cited above, §§ 34-35, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 31-33). In view of the relevant circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the prison authorities were made sufficiently aware of the applicant’s medical situation and had an opportunity to offer redress (see paragraphs 11-14 above). Consequently, having regard to the above case‑law on the subject matter, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion.30. The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment in prison is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. Submissions by the parties31. The Government firstly submitted that the positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention did not encompass an obligation on States to conduct compulsory screening for the presence of tuberculosis. They claimed in this connection that the first time the applicant had voiced his grievances concerning possible infection with TB was in January 2010, and by February 2010 he had been provided with all the required medical examinations and treatment. Hence, the examination for TB was not belated.32. With respect to the anti-tuberculosis treatment itself, the Government argued, relying on the relevant medical reports, that the applicant had been provided with the necessary medical assistance without interruption since his diagnosis was revealed. At the initial stage he had been administered with comprehensive in-patient treatment in the prison hospital and Ksani prison, which had included the relevant tests, repeated consultations with medical specialists, the necessary medication, and so on. Subsequently, the applicant had been transferred to Rustavi no. 1 Prison. The Government explained that this had become possible only after a significant improvement in the applicant’s medical condition. They dismissed the applicant’s allegation according to which Rustavi no. 1 Prison was not capable of providing him with adequate medical care. The Government submitted in this connection a letter dated 18 August 2010 from the Ministry of Prisons, according to which the DOTS programme, which allows for the provision of the relevant anti-tuberculosis drugs to infected prisoners, has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 prison since 10 June 2010.33. The Government also claimed with respect to his other diseases that the applicant had been provided with the requisite medical treatment from the very beginning of his detention. In support, they submitted, as regards the treatment allegedly available in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a letter of the prison Governor dated 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 13 above) and an unnamed and undated one-page extract from a medical file, according to which Finlepsin had been provided to the applicant for his epilepsy. As regards the post-February 2010 period, the Government submitted a copy of the applicant’s full medical file. The relevant excerpts showed, according to the Government, that the applicant had been provided with adequate drug‑based treatment for his epilepsy, chronic bronchitis and other minor ailments. The applicant’s diagnosis of circulatory dystonia had not been confirmed.34. In reply, the applicant reiterated his complaint that the treatment dispensed to him in prison had been inadequate. Notably, he noted that firstly his medical examination, despite repeated medical complaints, had been conducted with substantial delay, which had had a detrimental effect on his medical condition; moreover, his eight-month anti-TB treatment course in Ksani no. 8 Prison had suddenly been interrupted by his unjustified transfer on 23 July 2010 to Rustavi no. 1 Prison, which had not been properly equipped to treat him. Lastly, the applicant vaguely claimed that he had not been treated for the rest of his diseases.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles35. The relevant general principles concerning the adequacy of medical treatment in prisons have been summarised by the Court in the cases of Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 69-70, Jeladze, cited above, §§ 41-42, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 39-40.(b) Application of the principles to the present case36. The Court considers that the applicant’s current complaint could be divided into two periods, before and after the applicant’s diagnosis with TB in February 2010.(i) Before February 201037. The Court notes that the applicant was arrested on 4 October 2007 and put immediately in pre-trial detention. In November 2008 he was diagnosed with, inter alia, chronic bronchitis.38. At this point, the Court would first address the Government’s argument concerning the timing of the applicant’s TB test (see paragraph 31 above). The gravity of the problem of tuberculosis in the Georgian prisons, as well as the role of the above-mentioned screening in minimising the spread of this disease, was already acknowledged by the Court in its case‑law on the matter (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, §§ 103‑105, 3 March 2009; see also, Poghosyan, cited above, § 69, and, mutatis mutandis, Jeladze, cited above, § 44). In the present case the applicant did not have a screening test for tuberculosis during the initial two and a half years of his detention. Even after his diagnosis with chronic bronchitis, his requests for medical assistance were left unnoticed (see paragraphs 11-14 above). The Court finds this negligence on the part of the relevant prison authorities to be incompatible with the general obligation to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis and other contagious diseases in prisons (see Jeladze, cited above, § 44, with further references therein).39. On a more general note, the Court observes that the Government failed to submit any medical evidence concerning the applicant’s medical condition during the initial period of his detention, or the treatment administered to him during that time (see, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, § 70, cited above). Neither the letter of the prison Governor nor the undated one-page extract from a medical file (see paragraphs 13 and 33 above) can serve as a sufficient proof in this case (see Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 42-45).40. That being so, the Government, in the Court’s opinion, have failed in accounting for the detained applicant’s state of health and thus in discharging their part of the burden of proof (see, Jeladze, cited above, § 45 and, Irakli Mindadze, cited above, § 47; see also, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, cited above, § 75). The Court, hence, considers that until February 2010 the applicant was left without appropriate medical care in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.(ii) After February 201041. Turning now to the post-diagnosis period, the Court notes that in early February 2010 the applicant was diagnosed with smear-positive focal pulmonary TB at the stage of infiltration. He was immediately placed on the DOTS programme and started receiving all the required first-line anti‑tuberculosis agents on the premises of Ksani no. 8 Prison. On 21 May 2010 the applicant underwent a bacteriological sputum test which was smear-negative. Subsequently, on 23 July 2010, he was transferred to the medical unit of Rustavi no. 1 Prison, where he began the second phase of his anti-TB treatment.42. The Court notes that the applicant’s transfer to a normal prison took place only after the first-phase anti-tuberculosis treatment had yielded positive results (see paragraphs 18 and 32 above). It further observes, on the basis of the relevant medical evidence, that the applicant’s eight-month treatment was not interrupted but rather continued at Rustavi no. 1 Prison (see paragraph 32 above). Hence, the only issue pending before the Court is to assess whether Rustavi no. 1 Prison was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with the second-phase anti-TB treatment.43. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the DOTS programme has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 Prison since 10 June 2010, whilst the applicant was transferred to that prison on 23 July 2010; secondly, according to the available medical evidence, the applicant has continued to receive second-phase anti-TB drugs in line with the DOTS standards; thirdly, the available medical evidence reveals that the applicant has been under permanent medical supervision since his transfer to Rustavi no.1 Prison, with periodic medical check-ups conducted in the prison hospital. Lastly, the latest bacteriological sputum tests performed on the applicant confirmed the smear-negative results.44. Against this background the Court finds the applicant’s argument concerning the inadequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment administered to him in Rustavi no. 1 Prison unsubstantiated. Whilst acknowledging that there may be advantages to anti-tuberculosis treatment provided on an in‑patient basis, the Court nevertheless concludes, having duly examined the applicant’s medical file, that there are not sufficient grounds for questioning the adequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment provided to the applicant following his diagnosis of February 2010.45. As regards the applicant’s other diseases, the Government submitted his full medical file, from which it appears that he has been placed under permanent medical supervision as far as the period after February 2010 concerns; the applicant’s epilepsy has been under control, as no epileptic seizures have been recorded and he has been provided with the required drug-based treatment for this and other of his medical conditions. The applicant failed to point to any specific inadequacies in this area.46. In view of the above, the Court finds no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to be applicant following his diagnosis of tuberculosis in February 2010.47. In the light of the conclusions reached above (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above), the Court does not consider that it is also necessary to consider this complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION48. The applicant alleged, relying on Article 3 of the Convention, that he had been beaten by unidentified prison officers on an unspecified date in Gldani no. 8 prison. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he also challenged the outcome of the criminal proceedings conducted against him. He maintained, inter alia, that the domestic courts had improperly assessed the circumstances of his case and that, instead of endorsing the incriminating evidence, the courts should have subscribed to his arguments in defence. Invoking Article 13 of the Convention, in conjunction with the above-mentioned provision, the applicant also complained that an application to the Supreme Court was not an effective judicial remedy, as that court had rejected his cassation appeal as inadmissible.49. In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage51. The applicant claimed 950 euros (EUR) in respect of expenses his family had incurred in supporting him in prison and EUR 23 for medicines he had purchased. In addition, he claimed EUR 4,250 in compensation for the expenses his family would have to incur to support him in prison for the remaining seventeen years of his imprisonment. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed EUR 45,000.52. The Government contested these claims, stating that they were groundless.53. The Court rejects as unsubstantiated the costs borne for the medicines. As regards the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged in connection with the applicant’s past and future living expenses in prison; it therefore rejects that claim. However, having regard to its conclusions under Article 3 of the Convention, and making its own assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,500 for non-pecuniary damage.B. Costs and expenses54. The applicant claimed, on the basis of two bank statements, EUR 166 in respect of his representation before the domestic court. He also claimed a total of EUR 66 for postal expenses, without submitting any relevant bills in support.55. The Government argued that this claim was unsubstantiated.56. In the light of its well-established case-law on the matter (see, for instance, Ghavtadze, cited above, §§ 118 and 120 and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, § 164, 27 May 2010), and having due regard to the insufficient documentary evidence in its possession, the Court rejects this claim.C. Default interest57. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY1. Declares the complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention concerning the alleged absence of adequate medical treatment for the applicant in prison and the lack of effective remedies in this regard admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inadequate medical treatment provided to the applicant in prison until February 2010;3. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to the applicant after February 2010;4. Holds that it is not necessary to consider the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;5. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,500 (four thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 23 April 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Santiago Quesada Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2013-04-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-118646', 'appno': '65391/09', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'GEO', 'extractedappno': '65391/09;47729/08;35254/07;1871/08;6439/10;32362/02;30628/02;35887/05;15010/04;45566/08;23204/07;18768/05', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;90;193', 'doc_id': '53d0f9b1-3e7d-44ce-bbbf-2d978647eac5'}, page_content='Jeladze v.

       "[(Document(metadata={'Word Count': 2319, 'The Law': '...I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION77. The applicants contended that the police operation at their home had subjected them to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, which provides:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”78. The applicants complained in particular that the manner in which the police operation had been conducted – before daybreak, by masked and heavily armed police officers who had forced their way in and pointed their weapons at them and had handcuffed Mr Gutsanov while forcing him to kneel down – had subjected them to a severe psychological ordeal amounting to degrading treatment.79. In their written observations of 6 January 2012, the applicants complained of the lack of a criminal investigation into their alleged ill‑treatment during the police operation of 31 March 2010.A. Admissibility1. Complaint concerning the police operation of 31 March 2010(a) The Government’s observations80. The Government submitted that this complaint should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and failure to comply with the six‑month time-limit, and because it was premature and the applicants did not have victim status.81. They observed firstly that the criminal investigation against Mr Gutsanov was still pending, with the result that the complaint under Article 3 was premature.82. In the Government’s view, the applicants had not raised their complaint alleging degrading treatment before the competent authorities. Furthermore, they had not lodged an action for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. They had therefore omitted to exhaust the remedies that were normally available and effective under domestic law.83. The Government went on to observe that, in an order of 7 April 2010, the Varna regional public prosecutor’s office had decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers who had entered the applicants’ home. The prosecuting authorities had noted, inter alia, that the police officers’ actions had not constituted any criminal offence. They further argued that the actions in question had in no sense been intended to undermine the applicants’ dignity or cause them any psychological harm; accordingly, they did not amount to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. In the Government’s view, the applicants could not therefore claim to be victims of a violation of their rights under that Article.(b) The applicants’ observations84. The applicants did not dispute the fact that they had not lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had entered their home on 31 March 2010. However, they argued that such a remedy would be manifestly ineffective for two reasons in particular. Firstly, no provision of Bulgarian criminal law made it a punishable offence to inflict degrading treatment on others stemming from psychological pressure. Secondly, as the Court had found in a series of cases concerning operations by special officers of the national police force, the authorities’ systematic refusal to reveal the identity of the officers concerned would make any criminal investigation concerning them ineffective.85. The decision not to prosecute issued by the regional public prosecutor’s office in the present case merely confirmed that a criminal complaint would have been ineffective. The public prosecutor had taken the decision not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers shortly after the file had been opened, on the sole basis of two reports by police officers and without having taken statements from any other witnesses or gathered other evidence. The applicants had not been informed of that decision and had been deprived of any opportunity of being involved in the investigation.86. As to a possible action for damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act, the applicants maintained that this could likewise not be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in their case. According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, section 1 of the Act, under the terms of which the State could be held liable for damage caused as a result of administrative action, was not applicable to action taken by police officers to enforce investigative measures in the context of criminal proceedings, which formed part of the judicial process rather than the performance of administrative duties. Furthermore, in a binding interpretative judgment delivered in 2005, the Supreme Court of Cassation had made clear that where administrative bodies including the police were implementing measures ordered by the judicial authorities, an action for damages against the State could be brought only against the latter and on the basis of section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. However, section 2 provided for compensation in only a limited number of situations. The only one that could possibly apply in the present case was Mr Gutsanov’s acquittal or the subsequent discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him. However, it would be difficult for the applicants to prove their allegations given that all the witnesses to the events were police officers who had taken part in the operation of 31 March 2010.(c) The Court’s assessment87. The Court observes at the outset that the Government raised several objections of inadmissibility in relation to the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of the parties’ submissions, it considers that the issues of compliance with the six-month time-limit and the allegedly premature nature of the application are closely linked to the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government. It therefore considers it appropriate first of all to determine whether the applicants in the present case complied with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies.(i) Objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies88. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to have exhausted the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among many other authorities, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 81, ECHR 2000‑VII, and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000‑VII).89. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once that has been demonstrated, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑IV).90. According to the Court’s established case-law, the remedy normally available in Bulgarian law in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment allegedly caused by police officers is a complaint to the prosecuting authorities (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 86, Reports 1998‑VIII; Osman and Osman v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 43233/98, 6 May 2004; and Kemerov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004). The applicants in the present case did not lodge such a complaint with the public prosecutor against the police officers who entered their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They contended in that regard that a complaint to the prosecuting authorities could not be regarded as an effective remedy in their case, in view of the nature of the ill-treatment to which they had been subjected and the deficiency of the domestic criminal-law provisions (see paragraph 84 above).91. The Court observes that in its judgment in Hristovi v. Bulgaria (no. 42697/05, § 95, 11 October 2011), it noted with concern the treatment accorded in Bulgarian criminal law to acts causing psychological suffering. It noted in particular that, with the exception of the very specific case of death threats, the Bulgarian Criminal Code did not provide for the criminalisation of acts by police officers giving rise to this kind of suffering, resulting, for example, from an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. Hence, unless a complainant alleged that he or she had sustained physical injury at the hands of the police, the authorities could not be required to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the acts complained of. The Court noted that this deficiency in the criminal law allowed those responsible for inflicting psychological trauma to escape criminal accountability for their actions.92. The applicants in the present case complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of the police operation carried out at their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They did not claim to have been physically assaulted by the police officers. It therefore appears that if they had lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers in question, the prosecuting authorities would have inevitably refused to institute criminal proceedings because of the same legal deficiency observed by the Court in Hristovi (cited above). It follows that the criminal-law remedy that was normally available and effective in cases of physical violence inflicted by the police was bound from the outset to fail in the particular circumstances complained of by the applicants. The Court cannot therefore criticise them for not having lodged a complaint with the prosecuting authorities against the officers involved in the police operation.93. The Court further observes that in its judgment in Mirosław Garlicki v. Poland (no. 36921/07, § 77, 14 June 2011), it acknowledged that the civil claim for compensation provided for by Polish law in cases of violations of personal rights such as the right to health, liberty, honour and human dignity constituted appropriate redress in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, in a case in which the applicant complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of his arrest by masked officers, which had taken place in front of a large number of people and had subsequently received extensive media coverage. It observes that the applicants in the present case also complained of the psychological effects of the police operation targeting them. The Government contended that the applicants could have lodged a claim for compensation under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 82 above). However, the Court considers that, in contrast to the case of Mirosław Garlicki (cited above, §§ 77 and 78), where the applicant had available to him several effective domestic remedies, any action for compensation lodged by the four applicants under section 1 or 2 of the above-mentioned Bulgarian Act would have had no prospect of success, for the reasons outlined below.94. The Court points out in this regard that section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act allows individuals to bring proceedings in tort against the State on account of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions of State authorities or officials in the performance of their administrative duties. According to the settled case-law of the highest courts in Bulgaria, acts performed by the investigating and prosecuting authorities in the context of criminal proceedings do not form part of their administrative duties and thus do not come within the ambit of section 1 of the above-mentioned Act (see paragraph 67 above and Iliya Stefanov, cited above, § 28). The Court observes that the police operation at the applicants’ home was carried out in the context of criminal proceedings and was aimed at arresting Mr Gutsanov and searching his home for evidence. Hence, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the operation formed part of the investigative measures taken in the course of those proceedings and did not engage the State’s liability in tort under section 1 of the above-mentioned Act.95. As regards the applicability of section 2 of the same Act, the Court observes that the only situations that might have been applicable in the circumstances of the case were a finding that Mr Gutsanov’s detention was unlawful and the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him or his acquittal at first instance or on appeal (see paragraph 67 above). However, the Court notes that the courts to which Mr Gutsanov applied for release found his detention to be in accordance with domestic law ... It further notes that, according to the latest information received by the first applicant, the criminal proceedings in question are still pending at the preliminary investigation stage ... In these circumstances, an action under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act as in force at the relevant time would have been bound to fail.96. The Court also notes that any action lodged under section 2 of the above-mentioned Act in the event of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov or his acquittal would not have amounted to express or tacit acknowledgment of the breach of his right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Any such action would have had to establish that the damage in question had occurred as a result of charges being brought for a criminal offence in proceedings which were subsequently discontinued or ended in an acquittal. Accordingly, the examination of the facts by the domestic courts would have been confined to purely formal findings and would not have encompassed the actual substance of the applicants’ complaints, namely what they saw as the unnecessary nature of the methods employed by the police in order to achieve the objective of the operation, and the adverse psychological effects of the law-enforcement operation on the four applicants.97. In sum, the Court considers that, because of the deficiencies in the domestic legislation, neither the criminal complaint nor the action for damages against the State referred to by the Government would have constituted sufficiently effective domestic remedies in the instant case. The criminal remedy would have been bound to fail because of the absence of any provisions in Bulgarian law making it an offence to inflict psychological suffering (see paragraphs 90-92 above), while an action for compensation against the State would have been ineffective because of the limited scope of the domestic courts’ review in the context of such proceedings (see paragraphs 94-96 above). The Government did not refer to any other remedy capable of affording redress to the applicants for the alleged violation of their rights under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of these considerations and of the arguments outlined above, the Court considers that the Government’s rejection of non-exhaustion should be rejected.(ii) Compliance with the other conditions of admissibility98. The Government also maintained that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention had been lodged prematurely as the preliminary investigation concerning Mr Gutsanov was still pending. The Court can discern no direct link between the criminal proceedings to which the Government referred and the applicants’ complaint: the proceedings in question are not designed to establish whether the agents of the State safeguarded the applicants’ physical well-being or dignity, but rather to ascertain whether Mr Gutsanov was guilty of conspiracy and of various other criminal offences linked to his position as chairman of Varna municipal council ...99. Even assuming that the Government expect the criminal proceedings to be discontinued or Mr Gutsanov to be acquitted, which would allow him to lodge a claim for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 95 above), the Court reiterates that an action of this kind could not lead to a finding of a violation of the applicants’ right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment during the police operation at their home (see paragraph 96 above). In view of these considerations, the Court cannot criticise the applicants for having applied to it before the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov were concluded. It follows that the present complaint is not premature and that the Government’s preliminary objection should be rejected.100. The Government also contended that the applicants had not complied with the six-month time-limit laid down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the six-month rule is closely linked to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as the six-month period runs from the date of the decision considered as final for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). Nevertheless, where no adequate remedy is available in domestic law, the six-month period in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place (see Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, § 155, ECHR 2005‑XI).101. In examining the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government, the Court noted that none of the remedies they referred to satisfied the effectiveness requirement under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Thus, in the present case, the start of the six-month period should be the date of the events giving rise to the complaint under Article 3, that is to say 31 March 2010. As the applicants lodged their application on 21 May 2010, the Court notes that the six-month time-limit for lodging an application with it was complied with in the instant case. The objection as to inadmissibility raised in this regard must therefore also be rejected.102. Lastly, the Government disputed the applicants’ victim status, arguing that they had not been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court considers that this objection should be joined to the examination of the merits of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. It notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Complaint concerning the lack of a criminal investigation into the events103. The Court observes that the applicants raised this complaint in their written observations of 6 January 2012. In examining the admissibility of their application under the substantive aspect of Article 3, however, it noted that any criminal complaint seeking the opening of an investigation into the events would be bound to fail from the outset in view of the absence of any provision in domestic law laying down criminal penalties in respect of acts committed by police officers which cause psychological suffering (see paragraph 92 above); this argument was, moreover, advanced by the applicants themselves (see paragraph 84 above).104. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled case-law, the starting-point of the six-month period for lodging an application with it is the date on which the act complained of occurred, where domestic law does not afford appropriate remedies (see paragraph 100 above). It therefore considers that, in the present case, the six-month period for lodging an application under the procedural limb of Article 3 started on 31 March 2010. The applicants formulated their complaint one year and nine months later. It follows that this complaint was submitted out of time and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.B. Merits1. The parties’ submissions(a) The applicants105. The applicants submitted that the manner in which the police operation at their home had been carried out was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. On 31 March 2010, before dawn, a group of masked and heavily armed police officers had forced their way into their house without prior authorisation. The special officers had entered Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi’s bedroom and pointed their weapons at the couple’s two minor daughters. Mr Gutsanov, an influential and respected politician, had been forced to kneel down and been handcuffed.106. In the applicants’ view, there had been no reason for the police operation to be planned and carried out in this manner, in particular as Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi were respectable people who were well known in the city. Neither of them had a criminal record and there had been no reason to suppose that they would offer resistance to the law-enforcement officers. The search of their home did not constitute an urgent investigative measure under Article 161 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the applicants, all these elements pointed to a real intention to intimidate them, undermine their dignity and induce a feeling of powerlessness in the face of the actions of the law-enforcement officers.107. The police officers’ actions had had an adverse psychological impact on the applicants. In particular, Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, aged five and seven, had been subjected to considerable psychological pressure, as noted by the psychiatrists who had examined them shortly after the events in issue. Mr Gutsanov, a respected politician belonging to an opposition political party, had been the victim of a brutal arrest which had been widely covered in the media and which, together with the arrests of other politicians, formed part of a propaganda campaign by the ruling party. The psychological effects of the treatment complained of had been sufficiently severe to exceed the threshold required by Article 3 and for the treatment in question to be characterised as “degrading”.(b) The Government108. The Government contested the applicants’ allegations and their version of events. They submitted that the police operation of 31 March 2010 had been planned meticulously and carried out in a way which respected the applicants’ dignity and their rights. Mr Gutsanov’s arrest and the search of his home had been carried out in the context of a criminal investigation into serious offences involving several suspected accomplices. The police had been informed that Mr Gutsanov kept a gun in his home.109. The police operation had been launched after sunrise, that is to say after 6 a.m. The police had knocked on the gate of the applicants’ property, announced their presence and requested that the metal gate be opened. The security guard had opened the gate but explained that he did not have a key to the front door of the house. The police had run towards the door and knocked on it, demanding that it be opened immediately. Mr Gutsanov had appeared twice at the window of the house; he had seen and identified the police by their uniforms but had not come down to open the door. At that point, fearing that he might destroy evidence, fetch his firearm or try to escape, the special officers had forced open the door of the house. They had apprehended Mr Gutsanov on the second floor while he was trying to enter a bedroom where his wife and two children were.110. According to the Government, Mr Gutsanov had not been forced to kneel down. The officers had placed the handcuffs on him without using special immobilisation techniques and they had not pointed their weapons at his wife and daughters. The only officer who had gone into the bedroom on the second floor had been carrying only an electric stun gun and had not addressed the children or Mrs Gutsanova. The special officers had stayed in the house for only a few minutes and had left the premises after Mr Gutsanov’s arrest. Shortly afterwards, the applicant’s handcuffs had been removed.111. The police officers’ actions had complied with domestic law. The search had been approved by a judge within twenty-four hours of being carried out and the regional public prosecutor’s office, on the basis of the information supplied by the authorities, had found that the police officers had not committed any criminal offence.112. The Government conceded that the entry of the police into their home, and the search of the house, had undoubtedly aroused negative feelings in the applicants. However, they submitted that these were the normal and inevitable consequence of this kind of investigative measure; hence, the unpleasantness caused had not exceeded the threshold of severity beyond which Article 3 of the Convention applied. This was borne out, for instance, by the fact that the elder of the two girls had been taken to school as usual. The Government also maintained that if Mr Gutsanov had opened the front door of the house, the police officers would not have needed to resort to special measures to enter his home, which would have spared the members of his family the unpleasantness they had experienced.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Establishment of the facts113. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention must be supported by appropriate evidence. To establish the facts, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Salman, cited above, § 100).114. The Court notes that the events surrounding the police operation at the home of the four applicants were not the subject of any review by the domestic courts. When faced with similar situations, the Court has carried out its own assessment of the facts while complying with the rules laid down by its own case-law (see, by way of example, Sashov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 14383/03, § 48, 7 January 2010).115. On the basis of these principles, the Court deems it appropriate to take as the starting-point of its analysis the circumstances not disputed between the parties and the evidence adduced by them. It will also take into account those allegations by the parties which are sufficiently corroborated by the undisputed facts and the evidence adduced.116. It is not disputed between the parties that the police operation at the applicants’ home began shortly after 6.30 a.m. on 31 March 2010. The footage from the property’s CCTV cameras made available to the Court, and the weather report from the Varna meteorological service, corroborated the applicants’ allegation that the operation took place before sunrise, mainly around dawn (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).117. The parties also agree that the police operations team was made up of uniformed officers, plain clothes officers and special officers who were armed and masked. The video footage submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 21 above) and the reports submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 27 above) corroborate this.118. The fact that there was a firearm and ammunition in the applicants’ home is also undisputed and is established by the search report. It is clear from the Government’s observations and the reports they submitted that the police officers had been alerted by their superior officers to the presence of the weapon (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above).119. It is also common ground between the parties that the gate to the applicants’ property was opened voluntarily by the security guard at the request of the police officers (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above). Moreover, the scene was filmed and recorded by the property’s CCTV system (see paragraph 21 above). The parties also agree that the security guard informed the police officers of the identity of those present in the house and the fact that he did not have a key to the front door, and that the door was forced by the special officers who entered the house and arrested Mr Gutsanov (see paragraphs 13, 14, 24 and 25 above).120. Neither of the parties disputes the fact that the applicants were not physically injured during the police operation. The certificates attesting to the psychiatric examinations carried out on Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above) were not disputed by the Government.121. The first discrepancy between the parties’ version of events concerns the description of Mr Gutsanov’s conduct. According to the Government, he appeared twice at one of the windows of the house, saw the police officers and heard their calls but did not open the front door (see paragraph 25 above). The first applicant, meanwhile, stated that he had not realised that it was a police operation until the special officers entered the house and began to climb the stairs (see paragraph 16 above).122. The evidence available to the Court does not enable it to determine whether the applicant did actually appear at the window of his house and deliberately refused to open the front door to the police officers. However, it notes that it is not disputed that the police officers knocked at the front gate of the property and announced their presence to the security guard by calling out. According to the police officers, they then knocked on the front door of the house and called out “Police! Open up!”. This assertion is corroborated by the statements made by Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi, according to which they were woken by shouts and knocking at the door of the house (see paragraph 15 above). Mr Gutsanov stated that he had gone down to the first floor of the house to fetch the two children before going back up to the bedroom on the second floor. This claim was corroborated by the version of the police officers who saw the outline of a man through the windows of the house (see paragraph 25 above).123. As to the exact place in which Mr Gutsanov was arrested, the Court observes that he himself admitted in his statement that when the police officers forced the door and issued verbal warnings, he had run up to the bedroom on the second floor where his wife and children were (see paragraph 16 above). The Court is not in a position to determine whether Mr Gutsanov was arrested inside the bedroom on the second floor of the house, as he claimed, or on the second-floor landing after he had come out of the bedroom of his own volition, as claimed by the Government. Nor has it been established beyond any reasonable doubt that the police officers spoke to Mrs Gutsanova and asked her to cover the children with the duvet. In any event the Court observes that, according to the witness evidence given by the special officers (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), they saw Mr Gutsanov’s wife and children inside the bedroom when they went up to the second floor of the house in pursuit of Mr Gutsanov. The Court accepts that Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters also saw the armed and masked men, if only through the bedroom door.124. In the Court’s view, Mr Gutsanov’s claim that he was forced to kneel down so that the police officers could place the handcuffs on him has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. As regards the handcuffing, it is not disputed that the special officers placed handcuffs on Mr Gutsanov downstairs (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court observes that neither of the parties specified the length of time for which Mr Gutsanov remained in handcuffs. In any event, it cannot but observe that there is no evidence in the file to demonstrate that the first applicant was made to appear in handcuffs before the cameras of the journalists who had gathered outside the entrance to the property that day. Furthermore, the photograph taken as he was leaving the house, at around 1 p.m., shows no signs of him being handcuffed ... Accordingly, the Court considers that the present case falls to be distinguished in that regard from the case of Mirosław Garlicki, (cited above, § 75), in which the applicant was arrested at his workplace in front of his colleagues and patients, placed in handcuffs and filmed.(b) Compliance with Article 3 in the instant case125. The Court reiterates that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000‑IV). Psychological suffering may result from a situation in which State agents deliberately instil fear in individuals by threatening to kill or ill-treat them (see Hristovi, cited above, § 80).126. Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force by police officers during an arrest. Nevertheless, the use of force must be proportionate and absolutely necessary in the circumstances of the case (see, among many other authorities, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 76, ECHR 2000‑XII, and Altay v. Turkey, no. 22279/93, § 54, 22 May 2001). In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 56, Reports 1997‑VIII). The Court reiterates in particular that any recourse by agents of the State to physical force against a person which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, § 59, 28 July 2009). This strict proportionality test has also been applied by the Court in situations where the individuals concerned were already in the hands of the law‑enforcement agencies (see, among other authorities, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269; Rehbock, cited above, §§ 68-78; and Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, §§ 52-65, 24 January 2008).127. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the operation pursued the legitimate aim of carrying out an arrest, a search and a seizure of items as well as the public-interest objective of prosecuting criminal offences. The Court must be satisfied that a fair balance was struck in the circumstances of the case between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. It notes that, although the four applicants were not physically injured in the course of the impugned police operation, the latter necessarily entailed a degree of physical force. The front door of the house was forced open by the special operations team, Mr Gutsanov was immobilised by masked armed officers, led downstairs by force and handcuffed. The Court must therefore establish whether this use of physical force was proportionate and absolutely necessary in the instant case.128. The aim of the police operation at the applicants’ home that day was to arrest Mr Gutsanov, who was a suspect in a criminal case concerning misappropriation of public funds, and to carry out a search of the premises to look for physical and documentary evidence in the context of the same criminal investigation. It emerges from the evidence in the file that the investigation in question had been opened five months previously, that there were several suspects in the case and that the authorities suspected the existence of a conspiracy (see paragraph 9 ... above). The case clearly did not concern a group of individuals suspected of committing violent criminal acts.129. With regard to Mr Gutsanov’s personality, the Court observes that he was a well-known political figure in Varna: at the material time he was Chairman of the city’s municipal council. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the file to suggest that he had a history of violence or that he might have presented a danger to the police officers conducting the operation at his home.130. It is true that Mr Gutsanov was the lawful owner of a firearm and ammunition which he kept at his home. This fact was known to the police and had been specifically mentioned at the briefing of the police team before the operation (see paragraph 23 above). This was undoubtedly a relevant factor which had to be taken into account by the officers during the operation at the applicants’ home. However, the Court considers that the presence of the weapon in the applicants’ home was not sufficient in itself to justify the deployment of a special operations team or the degree of force that was used in the instant case.131. It is clear from the file that the possible presence of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and minor children was not taken into consideration at any stage in planning and carrying out the police operation. The fact was not mentioned during the pre-operation briefing (see paragraph 23 above) and the police officers apparently paid no heed to the warning by the security guard that young children were present in the house (see paragraph 24 above).132. Of course, the Court cannot go so far as to require the law‑enforcement agencies not to arrest persons suspected of criminal offences in their homes whenever their children or spouses are present. However, it considers that the possible presence of family members at the scene of an arrest is a circumstance that must be taken into consideration in planning and carrying out this type of police operation. This was not done in the present case and the law-enforcement agencies did not contemplate any alternative means of carrying out the operation at the applicants’ home, such as staging the operation at a later hour or even deploying a different type of officer in the operation. Consideration of the legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her daughters was especially necessary since the former was not under suspicion of involvement in the criminal offences of which her husband was suspected, and her two daughters were psychologically vulnerable because they were so young (five and seven years of age).133. The Court also observes that the lack of prior judicial review of the necessity and lawfulness of the search left the planning of the operation entirely at the discretion of the police and the criminal investigation bodies and did not enable the rights and legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters to be taken into consideration. In the Court’s view, such prior judicial review, in the specific circumstances of the present case, would have enabled their legitimate interests to be weighed against the public-interest objective of arresting persons suspected of committing a criminal offence.134. As regards the psychological effects of the police operation on the applicants, the Court observes that police operations which entail intervention in the home and the arrest of suspects inevitably arouse negative emotions in the persons targeted. However, in the present case, there is concrete, undisputed evidence that Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters were very severely affected by the events. Mrs Gutsanova consulted a psychiatrist on two occasions complaining of insomnia and acute anxiety and was prescribed tranquillisers (see paragraph 31 above). The two girls were also examined by a psychiatrist who observed that, when recalling the events, they reacted by crying or displaying acute anxiety (see paragraph 30 above). Mrs Gutsanova stated that her younger daughter, B., had started stammering again (see paragraph 28 above). As for S., the couple’s elder daughter, the statements by her aunt and her schoolteacher indicated that she had been deeply affected by the police operation at her home and by her father’s arrest (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also considers that the fact that the police operation took place in the early morning and involved special officers wearing masks, who were seen by Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, served to heighten the feelings of fear and anxiety experienced by these three applicants, to the extent that the treatment to which they were subjected exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 of the Convention to apply. The Court therefore considers that these three applicants were subjected to degrading treatment.135. As regards the adverse psychological effects of the police operation on Mr Gutsanov, the Court cannot but observe that the first applicant did not produce any medical evidence to this effect. Nevertheless, he stated that the humiliation and anxiety he had experienced during the heavy-handed operation to arrest him, in front of the members of his family, had been sufficiently intense for Article 3 to apply in his case (see paragraph 107 above).136. The Court reiterates its findings to the effect that the police operation in question was planned and carried out without regard for a number of relevant factors such as the nature of the criminal offences of which Mr Gutsanov was suspected, the fact that he had no history of violence, and the possible presence of his wife and daughters in the family home. All these elements point clearly to the excessive nature of the deployment of special officers and special procedures in order to arrest the first applicant and enable the police to enter his home. The Court considers that, in the light of these circumstances, the manner in which Mr Gutsanov’s arrest was carried out – very early in the morning, by several armed and masked officers who forced their way in through the door of the house, and under the frightened gaze of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and two young daughters – aroused strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness in the first applicant, capable of humiliating and debasing him in his own eyes and in the eyes of his close relatives. The Court considers that the intensity of these feelings exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 to apply. Accordingly, Mr Gutsanov too was subjected to degrading treatment.137. In conclusion, having taken into account all the relevant circumstances in the present case, the Court considers that the police operation at the applicants’ home was not planned and carried out in such a way as to ensure that the means employed were strictly necessary in order to attain the ultimate objectives of arresting a person suspected of committing criminal offences and gathering evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. The four applicants were subjected to a psychological ordeal which aroused in them strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness and which, on account of its adverse effects, amounted to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3. There has therefore been a violation of that provision in the present case....FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Decides to join to the merits the Government’s objection regarding the applicants’ victim status in respect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention;2.

The applicant complained that his return to Iraq would involve a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Admissibility20. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been invoked or established. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. The submissions of the parties(a) The applicant21. The applicant claimed that, should he be returned to Baghdad or other parts of Iraq, he would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. He pointed out that the Christian minority was still in a vulnerable position in southern and central Iraq and that the authorities there could not guarantee the safety for Christians.22. The applicant referred to his statements made during the Swedish asylum proceedings. In his view, he had shown that he had been and further risked personal persecution and attacks due to his belonging to the Christian minority. He added that, while he had not been in Iraq since 2007, there was no indication that the threats against him were no longer relevant.23. As regards internal relocation, the applicant submitted that the security situation in the Kurdistan Region had recently deteriorated. He also maintained that a reference person was required in order to settle in that region. He had no family or relatives there, and would thus not be able to present a reference to the Kurdish authorities. Consequently, relocation to the Kurdistan Region was neither possible nor reasonable for him.24. The applicant also mentioned that, while he had been separated from and in conflict with his wife, they had recently reunited (thus, in early 2012) and were planning to live together.(b) The Government25. The Government acknowledged that country-of-origin information showed that the general security situation in the southern and central parts of Iraq was still serious and that Christians was one of the more exposed groups. Furthermore, recent information suggested that professionals such as academics, judges and lawyers, doctors and other medical personnel as well as athletes had been prime targets for various extremist groups. However, the Government maintained that there was no general need of protection for all Christians or for all members of other groups in Iraq and, that, consequently, assessments of protection needs should be made on an individual basis.26. As to the applicant’s personal situation, the Government submitted that the applicant had failed to substantiate that there was a connection between the threats he had received from the Mujahedin and the kidnapping of his son, on the one hand, and the threats and assaults to which his wife had been subjected, on the other. Taking into account also the five years that had passed since the applicant had left Iraq, the Government considered that it had not been established that he would run a personal risk of ill-treatment if returned to Iraq.27. In any event, referring to international reports on Iraq as well as information obtained from the Migration Board, the Government contended that there was an internal flight alternative for the applicant in the three northern governorates of the Kurdistan Region. Allegedly, he would be able to enter without any restrictions or sponsor requirements into this region, which had been identified as the safest and most stable in Iraq, and he would be able to settle there, with access to the same public services as other residents. As to the applicant’s personal circumstances in relation to the possibility to relocate internally, the Government stressed that he is an adult man, born in 1968, and that no information had emerged about his health or any other circumstances that indicated that he was not fit for work. Thus, he would be able to provide for himself, even in an area of Iraq where he lacked a social network.28. The Government further asserted that the Migration Board and the courts had provided the applicant with effective guarantees against arbitrary refoulement and had made thorough assessments, adequately and sufficiently supported by national and international source materials. In the proceedings, the applicant had been given many opportunities to present his case, through interviews conducted by the Board with an interpreter present and by being invited to submit written submissions, at all stages assisted by legal counsel. Moreover, having regard to the expertise held by the migration bodies, the Government maintained that significant weight should be given to their findings.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles29. The Court reiterates that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, for example, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, § 67; Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997‑VI, p. 2264, § 42; and Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006-XII). However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-125, ECHR 2008-...).30. The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assesses the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, § 40).31. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, § 96; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, § 128). It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker’s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007; and Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37913/05, 27 March 2008).32. In cases concerning the expulsion of asylum seekers, the Court does not itself examine the actual asylum applications or verify how the States honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. It must be satisfied, though, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other contracting or non-contracting states, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 119, 17 July 2008).(b) The general situation in Iraq33. The Court notes that a general situation of violence will not normally in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of an expulsion (H.L.R. v. France, cited above, § 41). However, the Court has never excluded the possibility that the general situation of violence in a country of destination may be of a sufficient level of intensity as to entail that any removal to it would necessarily breach Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases of general violence, where there is a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 115).34. While the international reports on Iraq attest to a continued difficult situation, including indiscriminate and deadly attacks by violent groups, discrimination as well as heavy-handed treatment by authorities, it appears that the overall situation is slowly improving. In the case of F.H. v. Sweden (no. 32621/06, § 93, 20 January 2009), the Court, having at its disposal information material upto and including the year 2008, concluded that the general situation in Iraq was not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of a person’s return to that country. Taking into account the international and national reports available today, the Court sees no reason to alter the position taken in this respect four years ago.35. However, the applicant did not only claim that the general situation in Iraq was too unsafe for his return, but also that his status as a member of the Christian minority would put him at real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3.(c) The situation of Christians in Iraq36. In the mentioned case of F.H. v. Sweden, following its conclusion that the general situation in Iraq was not sufficient to preclude all returns to the country, the Court had occasion to examine the risks facing the applicant on account of his being Christian. It concluded then that he would not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment on the basis of his religious affiliation alone. In so doing, the Court had regard to the occurrence of attacks against Christians, some of them deadly, but found that they had been carried out by individuals rather than organised groups and that the applicant would be able to seek protection from the Iraqi authorities who would be willing and able to help him (§ 97 of the judgment).37. During the subsequent four years, attacks on Christians have continued, including the attack on 31 October 2010 on the Catholic church Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad, claiming more than 50 victims. The available evidence rather suggests that, in comparison with 2008/09, such violence has escalated. While still the great majority of civilians killed in Iraq are Muslims, a high number of attacks have been recorded in recent years which appear to have specifically targeted Christians and been conducted by organised extremist groups. As noted by the UNHCR (see M.Y.H. and Others, § 25) and others, Christians form a vulnerable minority in the southern and central parts of Iraq, either directly because of their faith or because of their perceived wealth or connections with foreign forces and countries or the practice of some of them to sell alcohol. The UK Border Agency concluded in December 2011 that the authorities in these parts of the country were generally unable to protect Christians and other religious minorities (M.Y.H. and Others, § 26).38. The question arises whether the vulnerability of the Christian group and the risks which the individuals face on account of their faith make it impossible to return members of this group to Iraq without violating their rights under Article 3. The Court considers, however, that it need not determine this issue, as there is an internal relocation alternative available to them in the Kurdistan Region. This will be examined in the following.(d) The possibility of relocation to the Kurdistan Region39. The Court reiterates that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight or relocation alternative in their assessment of an individual’s claim that a return to the country of origin would expose him or her to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision. However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of ill‑treatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, § 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).40. The three northern governorates – Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah – forming the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, or KRI, are, according to international sources, a relatively safe area. While there have been incidents of violence and threats, the rights of Christians are generally considered to be respected. As noted by various sources, large numbers of Christians have travelled to the Kurdistan Region and found refuge there.41. As regards the possibility of entering the KRI, some sources state that the border checks are often inconsistent, varying not only from governorate to governorate but also from checkpoint to checkpoint (see the UNHCR Guidelines and the Finnish/Swiss report, which appears to rely heavily on the UNHCR’s conclusions in this respect, M.Y.H. and Others, §§ 30 and 35 respectively). However, the difficulties faced by some at the KRI checkpoints do not seem to be relevant for Christians. This has been noted by, among others, the UNHCR. Rather, members of the Christian group are given preferential treatment as compared to others wishing to enter the Kurdistan Region. As stated by a representative of an international organisation and the head of Asaysih, the KRI general security authority, to investigators of the Danish/UK fact-finding mission, this is because Christians are at particular risk of terrorist attacks in southern and central Iraq and as the Christians are not considered to pose any terrorist threat themselves (at 4.34 and 8.19 of the report, M.Y.H. and Others, § 36).42. Moreover, while Christians may be able to enter the three northern governorates without providing any documentation at all (see Danish/UK report, at 4.34), in any event there does not seem to be any difficulty to obtain identity documents in case old ones have been lost. As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, § 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, § 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI. It appears that the UNHCR is of the same opinion as regards entry, although its statement in the Guidelines directly concerns only the requirements of a tourist (M.Y.H. and Others, § 30). The Finnish/Swiss report states that Christians may be able to nominate senior clerics as sponsors (M.Y.H. and Others, § 35); thus, they do not have to have a personal acquaintance to vouch for them.43. Internal relocation inevitably involves certain hardship. Various sources have attested that people who relocate to the Kurdistan Region may face difficulties, for instance, in finding proper jobs and housing there, not the least if they do not speak Kurdish. Nevertheless, the evidence before the Court suggests that there are jobs available and that settlers have access to health care as well as financial and other support from the UNHCR and local authorities. In any event, there is no indication that the general living conditions in the KRI for a Christian settler would be unreasonable or in any way amount to treatment prohibited by Article 3. Nor is there a real risk of his or her ending up in the other parts of Iraq.44. In conclusion, therefore, the Court considers that relocation to the Kurdistan Region is a viable alternative for a Christian fearing persecution or ill-treatment in other parts of Iraq. The reliance by a Contracting State on such an alternative would thus not, in general, give rise to an issue under Article 3.(e) The particular circumstances of the applicant45. It remains for the Court to determine whether, despite what has been stated above, the personal circumstances of the applicant would make it unreasonable for him to settle in the Kurdistan Region. In this respect, the Court first notes that the applicant’s account was examined by the Migration Board and the Migration Court, which both gave extensive reasons for their decisions that he was not in need of protection in Sweden. The applicant was able to present the arguments he wished with the assistance of legal counsel and language interpretation.46. As regards the suffering which the applicant and his family experienced in Iraq, the Court notes, without underestimating their serious nature, that they all occurred in Baghdad. It has not been shown that he would be at risk in the Kurdistan Region, and the applicant’s misgivings as to the possibility for him to settle there are not supported by the information on the KRI available to the Court.47. The Court notes that the applicant’s wife and daughter have been granted permanent residence permits in Sweden and that the wife was expected to give birth to another child in October 2012. The applicant’s deportation would inevitably separate the applicant from his wife and children, at least temporarily, but the applicant may apply for a residence permit based on family ties upon his return to Iraq. It should further be borne in mind that the applicant has not complained, at any stage of the proceedings in the present case, of a violation of his right to respect for his family life. Should a future request for a residence permit based on family ties be rejected by the Swedish authorities, he is free to submit a new application to the Court under Article 8 of the Convention, supplying the Court with all the information necessary for it to examine whether his right under that provision has been respected.(f) Conclusion48. Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that, although the applicant, as Christian, belongs to a vulnerable minority and irrespective of whether he can be said to face, as a member of that group, a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the southern and central parts of Iraq, he may reasonably relocate to the Kurdistan Region, where he will not face such a risk. Neither the general situation in that region, including that of the Christian minority, nor any of the applicant’s personal circumstances indicate the existence of said risk.Consequently, his deportation to Iraq would not involve a violation of Article 3.II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT49. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.50. It considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see § 4 above) must continue in force until the present judgment becomes final or until the Court takes a further decision in this connection (see operative part).FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Declares unanimously the application admissible;2. Holds by five votes to two that the implementation of the deportation order against the applicant would not give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Decides unanimously to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until such time as the present judgment becomes final or until further order.Done in English, and notified in writing on 27 June 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Claudia Westerdiek Mark Villiger Registrar PresidentIn accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge Power-Forde joined by Judge Zupančič is annexed to this judgment.M.V.C.W.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v. Sweden, I voted against the majority in finding that Article 3 would not be breached in the event that the deportation order made in respect of this applicant were to be executed. My dissent was based on the failure of the majority to test whether the requisite guarantees required by the Court’s case law prior to a deportation based on internal flight options, were established in this case.However, apart from that question of principle in relation to internal flight options, I have serious doubts as to whether the applicant’s deportation would, in any event, be in compliance with Article 3 of the Convention.The applicant is a 45-year-old man from Baghdad who was and is an active member of the Syrian Orthodox church. He lived with his wife and two children in Baghdad. He has had a particularly severe history of suffering during the war in Iraq because of his religious belief. In February 2007 his wife received threatening letters warning her to leave her job teaching Arabic at an Iraqi university. His family was required to go into hiding. His son was abducted and strangled and his remains were dumped on a street. The police authorities were informed but little was done. A similar threat was then made on his daughter’s life. Eventually, the applicant and his family fled to Syria in September 2007 and, thereafter, the applicant went to Sweden to seek asylum.In the meantime, and having regard to the deteriorating situation in Syria, the applicant’s wife returned to Baghdad in 2010 in search of work. She was kidnapped, attacked and raped by a group of men. She finally came to Sweden with her daughter where both of them were granted asylum.Clearly, the applicant and his wife and daughter were separated for some time, not least, as a consequence of the legacy of war in their home country. However, it is equally clear that the applicant has since reunited with his wife and daughter and that they have been living together for some time. A third child has been born of their marriage in October 2012.Having regard to what the applicant has already endured—the loss of his home, the death of his son, the flight of his family, the assaults upon his wife, the fracturing of their relationship and the ultimate reunification of his family—the suffering that would be imposed upon him by separating him, once again, from his family and his newborn child and by forcing him to return to Iraq—would, to my mind, cross the threshold of suffering required by Article 3.I appreciate that the applicant’s claim is not brought under Article 8 of the Convention. I also recognise that the threat under Article 3 must be assessed in terms of future risk. However, when assessing future risk one has to have regard to the individual circumstances of each case and to the level of suffering to which an individual has already been exposed. Such previous experience may be sufficient to break a person’s moral or psychological resistance in the event that he or she is further exposed to additional suffering.To my mind, given what this applicant has already endured it would be inhuman and degrading to separate him once again from his immediate family, which he has finally managed to hold together despite the trauma of war. The additional suffering that this would entail would be sufficient, to my mind, to break his moral and psychological resistance and would extend beyond the level permitted by Article 3 of the Convention.The expulsion of a person on the basis that internal flight relocation is available may, in altogether different circumstances, be compatible with Article 3. However, having regard to the circumstances of this applicant’s case, his expulsion to Iraq would not, in my view. be compatible with that Article of the Convention.It is formalistic in the extreme to expect that the applicant should be forced to leave his wife and children, once again, purely for the purposes of travelling to the Kurdish region so that, from there, he may contact a Swedish Embassy and apply for family reunification.Therefore, both for the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in M.Y.H. and Others v Sweden and on the merits of this case, I consider that the applicant’s removal to Iraq would violate Article 3.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v.

The applicant complained, under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, of having contracted TB in prison, of insufficient medical care for his various diseases throughout the entire period of his detention, and of having been deprived of effective remedies in this respect. He further challenged the conditions of his detention in Rustavi nos. 1 and 6 Prisons in the periods between 18 July 2008 and 4 March 2010 and 23 July 2010 up to the present as inadequate. Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention read as follows:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A. Admissibility1. The parties’ arguments22. The Government argued that the complaint about poor conditions of detention was unsubstantiated. In support, they submitted two letters from the Governors of the prison facilities involved, describing in detail the conditions of the applicant’s detention. According to these letters, the applicant was being kept in satisfactory conditions; the sanitary and hygienic norms were met; he was allowed to take a shower at least once a week and had been provided with all basic items of hygiene. In Rustavi no. 1 Prison, an open-type prison, the applicant was allowed six hours’ outdoor exercise on a daily basis, whilst in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a closed institution, he had been allowed at least a one-hour walk per day. On the basis of the relevant service provider contracts, the Government further argued that the food available to the applicant in both establishments was prepared in accordance with the legally approved norms, and that the applicant was regularly provided with the basic items of hygiene. In sum, the conditions of the applicant’s detention were compatible with Article 3.23. As regards the applicant’s alleged infection with TB and the inadequacy of the medical treatment provided to him in prison, the Government submitted that these complaints were premature, as the applicant had neither filed, under the relevant administrative rules, complaints of a lack of medical care in prison, nor sought monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage under the relevant provisions of the General Administrative Code and the Civil Code. In support of the latter argument they submitted a case where the domestic authorities had awarded compensation for the death in detention of the plaintiff’s husband, which had been caused by a lack of appropriate medical treatment. This decision was adopted by the domestic court in the framework of the friendly settlement proceedings in the case of Gamrekelashvili v. Georgia ((dec.) no. 6439/10, 6 September 2011).24. In reply, the applicant reiterated his general allegations about poor conditions of sanitation and hygiene, lack of outdoor exercise, and the diet, without providing any concrete details.25. As regards the medical complaint, the applicant claimed that the administrative-law remedy proposed by the Government was completely ineffective, as it involved extremely time-consuming and inefficient court proceedings. He did not comment on the adequacy of the compensatory remedies suggested by the Government.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Conditions of detention26. The Court notes that information about conditions of detention falls within the knowledge of the domestic authorities. Accordingly, applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Still, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide – to the greatest possible extent – some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no. 32362/02, § 45, 20 May 2010, and Ukhan v. Ukraine, no. 30628/02, § 65, 18 December 2008).27. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the applicant’s allegations were formulated as vague and general statements (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above). While it is aware of the fact that poor conditions of detention constituted a general structural problem in the penal sector in Georgia at the material time (see, amongst others, Janiashvili v. Georgia, no. 35887/05, § 70, 27 November 2012) the Court cannot ignore the simple fact that the applicant failed to provide a detailed account concerning the conditions in which he was held (see, for example, Visloguzov, cited above, §§ 48-49, and Ukhan, cited above, § 65). In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that this part of the application has not been properly substantiated by the applicant (see Shkurenko v. Russia (dec.) no. 15010/04, 10 September 2009). Therefore, it should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.(b) Infection with TB28. As to the alleged infection with TB in prison, the applicant in the current case has never attempted to bring a civil claim for damages for his alleged infection. The Court notes, however, that it has previously examined a similar situation and found that a civil claim for damages under Article 207 of the General Administrative Code and Article 413 of the Civil Code was the most effective remedy to be used (see Goloshvili v. Georgia, no. 45566/08, §§ 24-25 and 32-33, 23 October 2012; see also Jeladze, cited above, § 35). The Court sees no reason to depart from its previous conclusion and considers that this aspect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.(c) Medical treatment29. As to the alleged absence of adequate medical care in prison, the Court reiterates that prior to 1 October 2010, the Georgian law and practice did not provide for an effective legal remedy allowing a claimant to obtain injunctive relief in a situation concerning lack of medical care in prison. Consequently, it was sufficient for an ill detainee, who wished to complain to the Court of a lack of adequate medical care, to have alerted the relevant domestic authorities about his or her state of health (see Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 51-54 and 57; Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above, §§ 53‑55; Goloshvili, cited above, §§ 34-35, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 31-33). In view of the relevant circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the prison authorities were made sufficiently aware of the applicant’s medical situation and had an opportunity to offer redress (see paragraphs 11-14 above). Consequently, having regard to the above case‑law on the subject matter, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion.30. The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment in prison is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. Submissions by the parties31. The Government firstly submitted that the positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention did not encompass an obligation on States to conduct compulsory screening for the presence of tuberculosis. They claimed in this connection that the first time the applicant had voiced his grievances concerning possible infection with TB was in January 2010, and by February 2010 he had been provided with all the required medical examinations and treatment. Hence, the examination for TB was not belated.32. With respect to the anti-tuberculosis treatment itself, the Government argued, relying on the relevant medical reports, that the applicant had been provided with the necessary medical assistance without interruption since his diagnosis was revealed. At the initial stage he had been administered with comprehensive in-patient treatment in the prison hospital and Ksani prison, which had included the relevant tests, repeated consultations with medical specialists, the necessary medication, and so on. Subsequently, the applicant had been transferred to Rustavi no. 1 Prison. The Government explained that this had become possible only after a significant improvement in the applicant’s medical condition. They dismissed the applicant’s allegation according to which Rustavi no. 1 Prison was not capable of providing him with adequate medical care. The Government submitted in this connection a letter dated 18 August 2010 from the Ministry of Prisons, according to which the DOTS programme, which allows for the provision of the relevant anti-tuberculosis drugs to infected prisoners, has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 prison since 10 June 2010.33. The Government also claimed with respect to his other diseases that the applicant had been provided with the requisite medical treatment from the very beginning of his detention. In support, they submitted, as regards the treatment allegedly available in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a letter of the prison Governor dated 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 13 above) and an unnamed and undated one-page extract from a medical file, according to which Finlepsin had been provided to the applicant for his epilepsy. As regards the post-February 2010 period, the Government submitted a copy of the applicant’s full medical file. The relevant excerpts showed, according to the Government, that the applicant had been provided with adequate drug‑based treatment for his epilepsy, chronic bronchitis and other minor ailments. The applicant’s diagnosis of circulatory dystonia had not been confirmed.34. In reply, the applicant reiterated his complaint that the treatment dispensed to him in prison had been inadequate. Notably, he noted that firstly his medical examination, despite repeated medical complaints, had been conducted with substantial delay, which had had a detrimental effect on his medical condition; moreover, his eight-month anti-TB treatment course in Ksani no. 8 Prison had suddenly been interrupted by his unjustified transfer on 23 July 2010 to Rustavi no. 1 Prison, which had not been properly equipped to treat him. Lastly, the applicant vaguely claimed that he had not been treated for the rest of his diseases.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles35. The relevant general principles concerning the adequacy of medical treatment in prisons have been summarised by the Court in the cases of Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 69-70, Jeladze, cited above, §§ 41-42, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 39-40.(b) Application of the principles to the present case36. The Court considers that the applicant’s current complaint could be divided into two periods, before and after the applicant’s diagnosis with TB in February 2010.(i) Before February 201037. The Court notes that the applicant was arrested on 4 October 2007 and put immediately in pre-trial detention. In November 2008 he was diagnosed with, inter alia, chronic bronchitis.38. At this point, the Court would first address the Government’s argument concerning the timing of the applicant’s TB test (see paragraph 31 above). The gravity of the problem of tuberculosis in the Georgian prisons, as well as the role of the above-mentioned screening in minimising the spread of this disease, was already acknowledged by the Court in its case‑law on the matter (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, §§ 103‑105, 3 March 2009; see also, Poghosyan, cited above, § 69, and, mutatis mutandis, Jeladze, cited above, § 44). In the present case the applicant did not have a screening test for tuberculosis during the initial two and a half years of his detention. Even after his diagnosis with chronic bronchitis, his requests for medical assistance were left unnoticed (see paragraphs 11-14 above). The Court finds this negligence on the part of the relevant prison authorities to be incompatible with the general obligation to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis and other contagious diseases in prisons (see Jeladze, cited above, § 44, with further references therein).39. On a more general note, the Court observes that the Government failed to submit any medical evidence concerning the applicant’s medical condition during the initial period of his detention, or the treatment administered to him during that time (see, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, § 70, cited above). Neither the letter of the prison Governor nor the undated one-page extract from a medical file (see paragraphs 13 and 33 above) can serve as a sufficient proof in this case (see Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 42-45).40. That being so, the Government, in the Court’s opinion, have failed in accounting for the detained applicant’s state of health and thus in discharging their part of the burden of proof (see, Jeladze, cited above, § 45 and, Irakli Mindadze, cited above, § 47; see also, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, cited above, § 75). The Court, hence, considers that until February 2010 the applicant was left without appropriate medical care in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.(ii) After February 201041. Turning now to the post-diagnosis period, the Court notes that in early February 2010 the applicant was diagnosed with smear-positive focal pulmonary TB at the stage of infiltration. He was immediately placed on the DOTS programme and started receiving all the required first-line anti‑tuberculosis agents on the premises of Ksani no. 8 Prison. On 21 May 2010 the applicant underwent a bacteriological sputum test which was smear-negative. Subsequently, on 23 July 2010, he was transferred to the medical unit of Rustavi no. 1 Prison, where he began the second phase of his anti-TB treatment.42. The Court notes that the applicant’s transfer to a normal prison took place only after the first-phase anti-tuberculosis treatment had yielded positive results (see paragraphs 18 and 32 above). It further observes, on the basis of the relevant medical evidence, that the applicant’s eight-month treatment was not interrupted but rather continued at Rustavi no. 1 Prison (see paragraph 32 above). Hence, the only issue pending before the Court is to assess whether Rustavi no. 1 Prison was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with the second-phase anti-TB treatment.43. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the DOTS programme has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 Prison since 10 June 2010, whilst the applicant was transferred to that prison on 23 July 2010; secondly, according to the available medical evidence, the applicant has continued to receive second-phase anti-TB drugs in line with the DOTS standards; thirdly, the available medical evidence reveals that the applicant has been under permanent medical supervision since his transfer to Rustavi no.1 Prison, with periodic medical check-ups conducted in the prison hospital. Lastly, the latest bacteriological sputum tests performed on the applicant confirmed the smear-negative results.44. Against this background the Court finds the applicant’s argument concerning the inadequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment administered to him in Rustavi no. 1 Prison unsubstantiated. Whilst acknowledging that there may be advantages to anti-tuberculosis treatment provided on an in‑patient basis, the Court nevertheless concludes, having duly examined the applicant’s medical file, that there are not sufficient grounds for questioning the adequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment provided to the applicant following his diagnosis of February 2010.45. As regards the applicant’s other diseases, the Government submitted his full medical file, from which it appears that he has been placed under permanent medical supervision as far as the period after February 2010 concerns; the applicant’s epilepsy has been under control, as no epileptic seizures have been recorded and he has been provided with the required drug-based treatment for this and other of his medical conditions. The applicant failed to point to any specific inadequacies in this area.46. In view of the above, the Court finds no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to be applicant following his diagnosis of tuberculosis in February 2010.47. In the light of the conclusions reached above (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above), the Court does not consider that it is also necessary to consider this complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION48. The applicant alleged, relying on Article 3 of the Convention, that he had been beaten by unidentified prison officers on an unspecified date in Gldani no. 8 prison. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he also challenged the outcome of the criminal proceedings conducted against him. He maintained, inter alia, that the domestic courts had improperly assessed the circumstances of his case and that, instead of endorsing the incriminating evidence, the courts should have subscribed to his arguments in defence. Invoking Article 13 of the Convention, in conjunction with the above-mentioned provision, the applicant also complained that an application to the Supreme Court was not an effective judicial remedy, as that court had rejected his cassation appeal as inadmissible.49. In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage51. The applicant claimed 950 euros (EUR) in respect of expenses his family had incurred in supporting him in prison and EUR 23 for medicines he had purchased. In addition, he claimed EUR 4,250 in compensation for the expenses his family would have to incur to support him in prison for the remaining seventeen years of his imprisonment. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed EUR 45,000.52. The Government contested these claims, stating that they were groundless.53. The Court rejects as unsubstantiated the costs borne for the medicines. As regards the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged in connection with the applicant’s past and future living expenses in prison; it therefore rejects that claim. However, having regard to its conclusions under Article 3 of the Convention, and making its own assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,500 for non-pecuniary damage.B. Costs and expenses54. The applicant claimed, on the basis of two bank statements, EUR 166 in respect of his representation before the domestic court. He also claimed a total of EUR 66 for postal expenses, without submitting any relevant bills in support.55. The Government argued that this claim was unsubstantiated.56. In the light of its well-established case-law on the matter (see, for instance, Ghavtadze, cited above, §§ 118 and 120 and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, § 164, 27 May 2010), and having due regard to the insufficient documentary evidence in its possession, the Court rejects this claim.C. Default interest57. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY1. Declares the complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention concerning the alleged absence of adequate medical treatment for the applicant in prison and the lack of effective remedies in this regard admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inadequate medical treatment provided to the applicant in prison until February 2010;3. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to the applicant after February 2010;4. Holds that it is not necessary to consider the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;5. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,500 (four thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 23 April 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Santiago Quesada Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2013-04-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-118646', 'appno': '65391/09', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'GEO', 'extractedappno': '65391/09;47729/08;35254/07;1871/08;6439/10;32362/02;30628/02;35887/05;15010/04;45566/08;23204/07;18768/05', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;90;193', 'doc_id': '53d0f9b1-3e7d-44ce-bbbf-2d978647eac5'}, page_content='Jeladze v.

       "[(Document(metadata={'Word Count': 2319, 'The Law': '...I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION77. The applicants contended that the police operation at their home had subjected them to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, which provides:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”78. The applicants complained in particular that the manner in which the police operation had been conducted – before daybreak, by masked and heavily armed police officers who had forced their way in and pointed their weapons at them and had handcuffed Mr Gutsanov while forcing him to kneel down – had subjected them to a severe psychological ordeal amounting to degrading treatment.79. In their written observations of 6 January 2012, the applicants complained of the lack of a criminal investigation into their alleged ill‑treatment during the police operation of 31 March 2010.A. Admissibility1. Complaint concerning the police operation of 31 March 2010(a) The Government’s observations80. The Government submitted that this complaint should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and failure to comply with the six‑month time-limit, and because it was premature and the applicants did not have victim status.81. They observed firstly that the criminal investigation against Mr Gutsanov was still pending, with the result that the complaint under Article 3 was premature.82. In the Government’s view, the applicants had not raised their complaint alleging degrading treatment before the competent authorities. Furthermore, they had not lodged an action for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. They had therefore omitted to exhaust the remedies that were normally available and effective under domestic law.83. The Government went on to observe that, in an order of 7 April 2010, the Varna regional public prosecutor’s office had decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers who had entered the applicants’ home. The prosecuting authorities had noted, inter alia, that the police officers’ actions had not constituted any criminal offence. They further argued that the actions in question had in no sense been intended to undermine the applicants’ dignity or cause them any psychological harm; accordingly, they did not amount to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. In the Government’s view, the applicants could not therefore claim to be victims of a violation of their rights under that Article.(b) The applicants’ observations84. The applicants did not dispute the fact that they had not lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had entered their home on 31 March 2010. However, they argued that such a remedy would be manifestly ineffective for two reasons in particular. Firstly, no provision of Bulgarian criminal law made it a punishable offence to inflict degrading treatment on others stemming from psychological pressure. Secondly, as the Court had found in a series of cases concerning operations by special officers of the national police force, the authorities’ systematic refusal to reveal the identity of the officers concerned would make any criminal investigation concerning them ineffective.85. The decision not to prosecute issued by the regional public prosecutor’s office in the present case merely confirmed that a criminal complaint would have been ineffective. The public prosecutor had taken the decision not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers shortly after the file had been opened, on the sole basis of two reports by police officers and without having taken statements from any other witnesses or gathered other evidence. The applicants had not been informed of that decision and had been deprived of any opportunity of being involved in the investigation.86. As to a possible action for damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act, the applicants maintained that this could likewise not be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in their case. According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, section 1 of the Act, under the terms of which the State could be held liable for damage caused as a result of administrative action, was not applicable to action taken by police officers to enforce investigative measures in the context of criminal proceedings, which formed part of the judicial process rather than the performance of administrative duties. Furthermore, in a binding interpretative judgment delivered in 2005, the Supreme Court of Cassation had made clear that where administrative bodies including the police were implementing measures ordered by the judicial authorities, an action for damages against the State could be brought only against the latter and on the basis of section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. However, section 2 provided for compensation in only a limited number of situations. The only one that could possibly apply in the present case was Mr Gutsanov’s acquittal or the subsequent discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him. However, it would be difficult for the applicants to prove their allegations given that all the witnesses to the events were police officers who had taken part in the operation of 31 March 2010.(c) The Court’s assessment87. The Court observes at the outset that the Government raised several objections of inadmissibility in relation to the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of the parties’ submissions, it considers that the issues of compliance with the six-month time-limit and the allegedly premature nature of the application are closely linked to the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government. It therefore considers it appropriate first of all to determine whether the applicants in the present case complied with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies.(i) Objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies88. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to have exhausted the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among many other authorities, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 81, ECHR 2000‑VII, and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000‑VII).89. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once that has been demonstrated, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑IV).90. According to the Court’s established case-law, the remedy normally available in Bulgarian law in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment allegedly caused by police officers is a complaint to the prosecuting authorities (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 86, Reports 1998‑VIII; Osman and Osman v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 43233/98, 6 May 2004; and Kemerov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004). The applicants in the present case did not lodge such a complaint with the public prosecutor against the police officers who entered their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They contended in that regard that a complaint to the prosecuting authorities could not be regarded as an effective remedy in their case, in view of the nature of the ill-treatment to which they had been subjected and the deficiency of the domestic criminal-law provisions (see paragraph 84 above).91. The Court observes that in its judgment in Hristovi v. Bulgaria (no. 42697/05, § 95, 11 October 2011), it noted with concern the treatment accorded in Bulgarian criminal law to acts causing psychological suffering. It noted in particular that, with the exception of the very specific case of death threats, the Bulgarian Criminal Code did not provide for the criminalisation of acts by police officers giving rise to this kind of suffering, resulting, for example, from an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. Hence, unless a complainant alleged that he or she had sustained physical injury at the hands of the police, the authorities could not be required to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the acts complained of. The Court noted that this deficiency in the criminal law allowed those responsible for inflicting psychological trauma to escape criminal accountability for their actions.92. The applicants in the present case complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of the police operation carried out at their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They did not claim to have been physically assaulted by the police officers. It therefore appears that if they had lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers in question, the prosecuting authorities would have inevitably refused to institute criminal proceedings because of the same legal deficiency observed by the Court in Hristovi (cited above). It follows that the criminal-law remedy that was normally available and effective in cases of physical violence inflicted by the police was bound from the outset to fail in the particular circumstances complained of by the applicants. The Court cannot therefore criticise them for not having lodged a complaint with the prosecuting authorities against the officers involved in the police operation.93. The Court further observes that in its judgment in Mirosław Garlicki v. Poland (no. 36921/07, § 77, 14 June 2011), it acknowledged that the civil claim for compensation provided for by Polish law in cases of violations of personal rights such as the right to health, liberty, honour and human dignity constituted appropriate redress in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, in a case in which the applicant complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of his arrest by masked officers, which had taken place in front of a large number of people and had subsequently received extensive media coverage. It observes that the applicants in the present case also complained of the psychological effects of the police operation targeting them. The Government contended that the applicants could have lodged a claim for compensation under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 82 above). However, the Court considers that, in contrast to the case of Mirosław Garlicki (cited above, §§ 77 and 78), where the applicant had available to him several effective domestic remedies, any action for compensation lodged by the four applicants under section 1 or 2 of the above-mentioned Bulgarian Act would have had no prospect of success, for the reasons outlined below.94. The Court points out in this regard that section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act allows individuals to bring proceedings in tort against the State on account of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions of State authorities or officials in the performance of their administrative duties. According to the settled case-law of the highest courts in Bulgaria, acts performed by the investigating and prosecuting authorities in the context of criminal proceedings do not form part of their administrative duties and thus do not come within the ambit of section 1 of the above-mentioned Act (see paragraph 67 above and Iliya Stefanov, cited above, § 28). The Court observes that the police operation at the applicants’ home was carried out in the context of criminal proceedings and was aimed at arresting Mr Gutsanov and searching his home for evidence. Hence, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the operation formed part of the investigative measures taken in the course of those proceedings and did not engage the State’s liability in tort under section 1 of the above-mentioned Act.95. As regards the applicability of section 2 of the same Act, the Court observes that the only situations that might have been applicable in the circumstances of the case were a finding that Mr Gutsanov’s detention was unlawful and the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him or his acquittal at first instance or on appeal (see paragraph 67 above). However, the Court notes that the courts to which Mr Gutsanov applied for release found his detention to be in accordance with domestic law ... It further notes that, according to the latest information received by the first applicant, the criminal proceedings in question are still pending at the preliminary investigation stage ... In these circumstances, an action under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act as in force at the relevant time would have been bound to fail.96. The Court also notes that any action lodged under section 2 of the above-mentioned Act in the event of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov or his acquittal would not have amounted to express or tacit acknowledgment of the breach of his right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Any such action would have had to establish that the damage in question had occurred as a result of charges being brought for a criminal offence in proceedings which were subsequently discontinued or ended in an acquittal. Accordingly, the examination of the facts by the domestic courts would have been confined to purely formal findings and would not have encompassed the actual substance of the applicants’ complaints, namely what they saw as the unnecessary nature of the methods employed by the police in order to achieve the objective of the operation, and the adverse psychological effects of the law-enforcement operation on the four applicants.97. In sum, the Court considers that, because of the deficiencies in the domestic legislation, neither the criminal complaint nor the action for damages against the State referred to by the Government would have constituted sufficiently effective domestic remedies in the instant case. The criminal remedy would have been bound to fail because of the absence of any provisions in Bulgarian law making it an offence to inflict psychological suffering (see paragraphs 90-92 above), while an action for compensation against the State would have been ineffective because of the limited scope of the domestic courts’ review in the context of such proceedings (see paragraphs 94-96 above). The Government did not refer to any other remedy capable of affording redress to the applicants for the alleged violation of their rights under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of these considerations and of the arguments outlined above, the Court considers that the Government’s rejection of non-exhaustion should be rejected.(ii) Compliance with the other conditions of admissibility98. The Government also maintained that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention had been lodged prematurely as the preliminary investigation concerning Mr Gutsanov was still pending. The Court can discern no direct link between the criminal proceedings to which the Government referred and the applicants’ complaint: the proceedings in question are not designed to establish whether the agents of the State safeguarded the applicants’ physical well-being or dignity, but rather to ascertain whether Mr Gutsanov was guilty of conspiracy and of various other criminal offences linked to his position as chairman of Varna municipal council ...99. Even assuming that the Government expect the criminal proceedings to be discontinued or Mr Gutsanov to be acquitted, which would allow him to lodge a claim for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 95 above), the Court reiterates that an action of this kind could not lead to a finding of a violation of the applicants’ right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment during the police operation at their home (see paragraph 96 above). In view of these considerations, the Court cannot criticise the applicants for having applied to it before the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov were concluded. It follows that the present complaint is not premature and that the Government’s preliminary objection should be rejected.100. The Government also contended that the applicants had not complied with the six-month time-limit laid down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the six-month rule is closely linked to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as the six-month period runs from the date of the decision considered as final for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). Nevertheless, where no adequate remedy is available in domestic law, the six-month period in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place (see Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, § 155, ECHR 2005‑XI).101. In examining the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government, the Court noted that none of the remedies they referred to satisfied the effectiveness requirement under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Thus, in the present case, the start of the six-month period should be the date of the events giving rise to the complaint under Article 3, that is to say 31 March 2010. As the applicants lodged their application on 21 May 2010, the Court notes that the six-month time-limit for lodging an application with it was complied with in the instant case. The objection as to inadmissibility raised in this regard must therefore also be rejected.102. Lastly, the Government disputed the applicants’ victim status, arguing that they had not been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court considers that this objection should be joined to the examination of the merits of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. It notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Complaint concerning the lack of a criminal investigation into the events103. The Court observes that the applicants raised this complaint in their written observations of 6 January 2012. In examining the admissibility of their application under the substantive aspect of Article 3, however, it noted that any criminal complaint seeking the opening of an investigation into the events would be bound to fail from the outset in view of the absence of any provision in domestic law laying down criminal penalties in respect of acts committed by police officers which cause psychological suffering (see paragraph 92 above); this argument was, moreover, advanced by the applicants themselves (see paragraph 84 above).104. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled case-law, the starting-point of the six-month period for lodging an application with it is the date on which the act complained of occurred, where domestic law does not afford appropriate remedies (see paragraph 100 above). It therefore considers that, in the present case, the six-month period for lodging an application under the procedural limb of Article 3 started on 31 March 2010. The applicants formulated their complaint one year and nine months later. It follows that this complaint was submitted out of time and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.B. Merits1. The parties’ submissions(a) The applicants105. The applicants submitted that the manner in which the police operation at their home had been carried out was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. On 31 March 2010, before dawn, a group of masked and heavily armed police officers had forced their way into their house without prior authorisation. The special officers had entered Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi’s bedroom and pointed their weapons at the couple’s two minor daughters. Mr Gutsanov, an influential and respected politician, had been forced to kneel down and been handcuffed.106. In the applicants’ view, there had been no reason for the police operation to be planned and carried out in this manner, in particular as Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi were respectable people who were well known in the city. Neither of them had a criminal record and there had been no reason to suppose that they would offer resistance to the law-enforcement officers. The search of their home did not constitute an urgent investigative measure under Article 161 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the applicants, all these elements pointed to a real intention to intimidate them, undermine their dignity and induce a feeling of powerlessness in the face of the actions of the law-enforcement officers.107. The police officers’ actions had had an adverse psychological impact on the applicants. In particular, Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, aged five and seven, had been subjected to considerable psychological pressure, as noted by the psychiatrists who had examined them shortly after the events in issue. Mr Gutsanov, a respected politician belonging to an opposition political party, had been the victim of a brutal arrest which had been widely covered in the media and which, together with the arrests of other politicians, formed part of a propaganda campaign by the ruling party. The psychological effects of the treatment complained of had been sufficiently severe to exceed the threshold required by Article 3 and for the treatment in question to be characterised as “degrading”.(b) The Government108. The Government contested the applicants’ allegations and their version of events. They submitted that the police operation of 31 March 2010 had been planned meticulously and carried out in a way which respected the applicants’ dignity and their rights. Mr Gutsanov’s arrest and the search of his home had been carried out in the context of a criminal investigation into serious offences involving several suspected accomplices. The police had been informed that Mr Gutsanov kept a gun in his home.109. The police operation had been launched after sunrise, that is to say after 6 a.m. The police had knocked on the gate of the applicants’ property, announced their presence and requested that the metal gate be opened. The security guard had opened the gate but explained that he did not have a key to the front door of the house. The police had run towards the door and knocked on it, demanding that it be opened immediately. Mr Gutsanov had appeared twice at the window of the house; he had seen and identified the police by their uniforms but had not come down to open the door. At that point, fearing that he might destroy evidence, fetch his firearm or try to escape, the special officers had forced open the door of the house. They had apprehended Mr Gutsanov on the second floor while he was trying to enter a bedroom where his wife and two children were.110. According to the Government, Mr Gutsanov had not been forced to kneel down. The officers had placed the handcuffs on him without using special immobilisation techniques and they had not pointed their weapons at his wife and daughters. The only officer who had gone into the bedroom on the second floor had been carrying only an electric stun gun and had not addressed the children or Mrs Gutsanova. The special officers had stayed in the house for only a few minutes and had left the premises after Mr Gutsanov’s arrest. Shortly afterwards, the applicant’s handcuffs had been removed.111. The police officers’ actions had complied with domestic law. The search had been approved by a judge within twenty-four hours of being carried out and the regional public prosecutor’s office, on the basis of the information supplied by the authorities, had found that the police officers had not committed any criminal offence.112. The Government conceded that the entry of the police into their home, and the search of the house, had undoubtedly aroused negative feelings in the applicants. However, they submitted that these were the normal and inevitable consequence of this kind of investigative measure; hence, the unpleasantness caused had not exceeded the threshold of severity beyond which Article 3 of the Convention applied. This was borne out, for instance, by the fact that the elder of the two girls had been taken to school as usual. The Government also maintained that if Mr Gutsanov had opened the front door of the house, the police officers would not have needed to resort to special measures to enter his home, which would have spared the members of his family the unpleasantness they had experienced.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Establishment of the facts113. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention must be supported by appropriate evidence. To establish the facts, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Salman, cited above, § 100).114. The Court notes that the events surrounding the police operation at the home of the four applicants were not the subject of any review by the domestic courts. When faced with similar situations, the Court has carried out its own assessment of the facts while complying with the rules laid down by its own case-law (see, by way of example, Sashov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 14383/03, § 48, 7 January 2010).115. On the basis of these principles, the Court deems it appropriate to take as the starting-point of its analysis the circumstances not disputed between the parties and the evidence adduced by them. It will also take into account those allegations by the parties which are sufficiently corroborated by the undisputed facts and the evidence adduced.116. It is not disputed between the parties that the police operation at the applicants’ home began shortly after 6.30 a.m. on 31 March 2010. The footage from the property’s CCTV cameras made available to the Court, and the weather report from the Varna meteorological service, corroborated the applicants’ allegation that the operation took place before sunrise, mainly around dawn (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).117. The parties also agree that the police operations team was made up of uniformed officers, plain clothes officers and special officers who were armed and masked. The video footage submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 21 above) and the reports submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 27 above) corroborate this.118. The fact that there was a firearm and ammunition in the applicants’ home is also undisputed and is established by the search report. It is clear from the Government’s observations and the reports they submitted that the police officers had been alerted by their superior officers to the presence of the weapon (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above).119. It is also common ground between the parties that the gate to the applicants’ property was opened voluntarily by the security guard at the request of the police officers (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above). Moreover, the scene was filmed and recorded by the property’s CCTV system (see paragraph 21 above). The parties also agree that the security guard informed the police officers of the identity of those present in the house and the fact that he did not have a key to the front door, and that the door was forced by the special officers who entered the house and arrested Mr Gutsanov (see paragraphs 13, 14, 24 and 25 above).120. Neither of the parties disputes the fact that the applicants were not physically injured during the police operation. The certificates attesting to the psychiatric examinations carried out on Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above) were not disputed by the Government.121. The first discrepancy between the parties’ version of events concerns the description of Mr Gutsanov’s conduct. According to the Government, he appeared twice at one of the windows of the house, saw the police officers and heard their calls but did not open the front door (see paragraph 25 above). The first applicant, meanwhile, stated that he had not realised that it was a police operation until the special officers entered the house and began to climb the stairs (see paragraph 16 above).122. The evidence available to the Court does not enable it to determine whether the applicant did actually appear at the window of his house and deliberately refused to open the front door to the police officers. However, it notes that it is not disputed that the police officers knocked at the front gate of the property and announced their presence to the security guard by calling out. According to the police officers, they then knocked on the front door of the house and called out “Police! Open up!”. This assertion is corroborated by the statements made by Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi, according to which they were woken by shouts and knocking at the door of the house (see paragraph 15 above). Mr Gutsanov stated that he had gone down to the first floor of the house to fetch the two children before going back up to the bedroom on the second floor. This claim was corroborated by the version of the police officers who saw the outline of a man through the windows of the house (see paragraph 25 above).123. As to the exact place in which Mr Gutsanov was arrested, the Court observes that he himself admitted in his statement that when the police officers forced the door and issued verbal warnings, he had run up to the bedroom on the second floor where his wife and children were (see paragraph 16 above). The Court is not in a position to determine whether Mr Gutsanov was arrested inside the bedroom on the second floor of the house, as he claimed, or on the second-floor landing after he had come out of the bedroom of his own volition, as claimed by the Government. Nor has it been established beyond any reasonable doubt that the police officers spoke to Mrs Gutsanova and asked her to cover the children with the duvet. In any event the Court observes that, according to the witness evidence given by the special officers (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), they saw Mr Gutsanov’s wife and children inside the bedroom when they went up to the second floor of the house in pursuit of Mr Gutsanov. The Court accepts that Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters also saw the armed and masked men, if only through the bedroom door.124. In the Court’s view, Mr Gutsanov’s claim that he was forced to kneel down so that the police officers could place the handcuffs on him has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. As regards the handcuffing, it is not disputed that the special officers placed handcuffs on Mr Gutsanov downstairs (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court observes that neither of the parties specified the length of time for which Mr Gutsanov remained in handcuffs. In any event, it cannot but observe that there is no evidence in the file to demonstrate that the first applicant was made to appear in handcuffs before the cameras of the journalists who had gathered outside the entrance to the property that day. Furthermore, the photograph taken as he was leaving the house, at around 1 p.m., shows no signs of him being handcuffed ... Accordingly, the Court considers that the present case falls to be distinguished in that regard from the case of Mirosław Garlicki, (cited above, § 75), in which the applicant was arrested at his workplace in front of his colleagues and patients, placed in handcuffs and filmed.(b) Compliance with Article 3 in the instant case125. The Court reiterates that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000‑IV). Psychological suffering may result from a situation in which State agents deliberately instil fear in individuals by threatening to kill or ill-treat them (see Hristovi, cited above, § 80).126. Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force by police officers during an arrest. Nevertheless, the use of force must be proportionate and absolutely necessary in the circumstances of the case (see, among many other authorities, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 76, ECHR 2000‑XII, and Altay v. Turkey, no. 22279/93, § 54, 22 May 2001). In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 56, Reports 1997‑VIII). The Court reiterates in particular that any recourse by agents of the State to physical force against a person which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, § 59, 28 July 2009). This strict proportionality test has also been applied by the Court in situations where the individuals concerned were already in the hands of the law‑enforcement agencies (see, among other authorities, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269; Rehbock, cited above, §§ 68-78; and Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, §§ 52-65, 24 January 2008).127. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the operation pursued the legitimate aim of carrying out an arrest, a search and a seizure of items as well as the public-interest objective of prosecuting criminal offences. The Court must be satisfied that a fair balance was struck in the circumstances of the case between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. It notes that, although the four applicants were not physically injured in the course of the impugned police operation, the latter necessarily entailed a degree of physical force. The front door of the house was forced open by the special operations team, Mr Gutsanov was immobilised by masked armed officers, led downstairs by force and handcuffed. The Court must therefore establish whether this use of physical force was proportionate and absolutely necessary in the instant case.128. The aim of the police operation at the applicants’ home that day was to arrest Mr Gutsanov, who was a suspect in a criminal case concerning misappropriation of public funds, and to carry out a search of the premises to look for physical and documentary evidence in the context of the same criminal investigation. It emerges from the evidence in the file that the investigation in question had been opened five months previously, that there were several suspects in the case and that the authorities suspected the existence of a conspiracy (see paragraph 9 ... above). The case clearly did not concern a group of individuals suspected of committing violent criminal acts.129. With regard to Mr Gutsanov’s personality, the Court observes that he was a well-known political figure in Varna: at the material time he was Chairman of the city’s municipal council. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the file to suggest that he had a history of violence or that he might have presented a danger to the police officers conducting the operation at his home.130. It is true that Mr Gutsanov was the lawful owner of a firearm and ammunition which he kept at his home. This fact was known to the police and had been specifically mentioned at the briefing of the police team before the operation (see paragraph 23 above). This was undoubtedly a relevant factor which had to be taken into account by the officers during the operation at the applicants’ home. However, the Court considers that the presence of the weapon in the applicants’ home was not sufficient in itself to justify the deployment of a special operations team or the degree of force that was used in the instant case.131. It is clear from the file that the possible presence of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and minor children was not taken into consideration at any stage in planning and carrying out the police operation. The fact was not mentioned during the pre-operation briefing (see paragraph 23 above) and the police officers apparently paid no heed to the warning by the security guard that young children were present in the house (see paragraph 24 above).132. Of course, the Court cannot go so far as to require the law‑enforcement agencies not to arrest persons suspected of criminal offences in their homes whenever their children or spouses are present. However, it considers that the possible presence of family members at the scene of an arrest is a circumstance that must be taken into consideration in planning and carrying out this type of police operation. This was not done in the present case and the law-enforcement agencies did not contemplate any alternative means of carrying out the operation at the applicants’ home, such as staging the operation at a later hour or even deploying a different type of officer in the operation. Consideration of the legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her daughters was especially necessary since the former was not under suspicion of involvement in the criminal offences of which her husband was suspected, and her two daughters were psychologically vulnerable because they were so young (five and seven years of age).133. The Court also observes that the lack of prior judicial review of the necessity and lawfulness of the search left the planning of the operation entirely at the discretion of the police and the criminal investigation bodies and did not enable the rights and legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters to be taken into consideration. In the Court’s view, such prior judicial review, in the specific circumstances of the present case, would have enabled their legitimate interests to be weighed against the public-interest objective of arresting persons suspected of committing a criminal offence.134. As regards the psychological effects of the police operation on the applicants, the Court observes that police operations which entail intervention in the home and the arrest of suspects inevitably arouse negative emotions in the persons targeted. However, in the present case, there is concrete, undisputed evidence that Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters were very severely affected by the events. Mrs Gutsanova consulted a psychiatrist on two occasions complaining of insomnia and acute anxiety and was prescribed tranquillisers (see paragraph 31 above). The two girls were also examined by a psychiatrist who observed that, when recalling the events, they reacted by crying or displaying acute anxiety (see paragraph 30 above). Mrs Gutsanova stated that her younger daughter, B., had started stammering again (see paragraph 28 above). As for S., the couple’s elder daughter, the statements by her aunt and her schoolteacher indicated that she had been deeply affected by the police operation at her home and by her father’s arrest (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also considers that the fact that the police operation took place in the early morning and involved special officers wearing masks, who were seen by Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, served to heighten the feelings of fear and anxiety experienced by these three applicants, to the extent that the treatment to which they were subjected exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 of the Convention to apply. The Court therefore considers that these three applicants were subjected to degrading treatment.135. As regards the adverse psychological effects of the police operation on Mr Gutsanov, the Court cannot but observe that the first applicant did not produce any medical evidence to this effect. Nevertheless, he stated that the humiliation and anxiety he had experienced during the heavy-handed operation to arrest him, in front of the members of his family, had been sufficiently intense for Article 3 to apply in his case (see paragraph 107 above).136. The Court reiterates its findings to the effect that the police operation in question was planned and carried out without regard for a number of relevant factors such as the nature of the criminal offences of which Mr Gutsanov was suspected, the fact that he had no history of violence, and the possible presence of his wife and daughters in the family home. All these elements point clearly to the excessive nature of the deployment of special officers and special procedures in order to arrest the first applicant and enable the police to enter his home. The Court considers that, in the light of these circumstances, the manner in which Mr Gutsanov’s arrest was carried out – very early in the morning, by several armed and masked officers who forced their way in through the door of the house, and under the frightened gaze of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and two young daughters – aroused strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness in the first applicant, capable of humiliating and debasing him in his own eyes and in the eyes of his close relatives. The Court considers that the intensity of these feelings exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 to apply. Accordingly, Mr Gutsanov too was subjected to degrading treatment.137. In conclusion, having taken into account all the relevant circumstances in the present case, the Court considers that the police operation at the applicants’ home was not planned and carried out in such a way as to ensure that the means employed were strictly necessary in order to attain the ultimate objectives of arresting a person suspected of committing criminal offences and gathering evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. The four applicants were subjected to a psychological ordeal which aroused in them strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness and which, on account of its adverse effects, amounted to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3. There has therefore been a violation of that provision in the present case....FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Decides to join to the merits the Government’s objection regarding the applicants’ victim status in respect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention;2.

The applicant complained that his return to Iraq would involve a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Admissibility20. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been invoked or established. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. The submissions of the parties(a) The applicant21. The applicant claimed that, should he be returned to Baghdad or other parts of Iraq, he would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. He pointed out that the Christian minority was still in a vulnerable position in southern and central Iraq and that the authorities there could not guarantee the safety for Christians.22. The applicant referred to his statements made during the Swedish asylum proceedings. In his view, he had shown that he had been and further risked personal persecution and attacks due to his belonging to the Christian minority. He added that, while he had not been in Iraq since 2007, there was no indication that the threats against him were no longer relevant.23. As regards internal relocation, the applicant submitted that the security situation in the Kurdistan Region had recently deteriorated. He also maintained that a reference person was required in order to settle in that region. He had no family or relatives there, and would thus not be able to present a reference to the Kurdish authorities. Consequently, relocation to the Kurdistan Region was neither possible nor reasonable for him.24. The applicant also mentioned that, while he had been separated from and in conflict with his wife, they had recently reunited (thus, in early 2012) and were planning to live together.(b) The Government25. The Government acknowledged that country-of-origin information showed that the general security situation in the southern and central parts of Iraq was still serious and that Christians was one of the more exposed groups. Furthermore, recent information suggested that professionals such as academics, judges and lawyers, doctors and other medical personnel as well as athletes had been prime targets for various extremist groups. However, the Government maintained that there was no general need of protection for all Christians or for all members of other groups in Iraq and, that, consequently, assessments of protection needs should be made on an individual basis.26. As to the applicant’s personal situation, the Government submitted that the applicant had failed to substantiate that there was a connection between the threats he had received from the Mujahedin and the kidnapping of his son, on the one hand, and the threats and assaults to which his wife had been subjected, on the other. Taking into account also the five years that had passed since the applicant had left Iraq, the Government considered that it had not been established that he would run a personal risk of ill-treatment if returned to Iraq.27. In any event, referring to international reports on Iraq as well as information obtained from the Migration Board, the Government contended that there was an internal flight alternative for the applicant in the three northern governorates of the Kurdistan Region. Allegedly, he would be able to enter without any restrictions or sponsor requirements into this region, which had been identified as the safest and most stable in Iraq, and he would be able to settle there, with access to the same public services as other residents. As to the applicant’s personal circumstances in relation to the possibility to relocate internally, the Government stressed that he is an adult man, born in 1968, and that no information had emerged about his health or any other circumstances that indicated that he was not fit for work. Thus, he would be able to provide for himself, even in an area of Iraq where he lacked a social network.28. The Government further asserted that the Migration Board and the courts had provided the applicant with effective guarantees against arbitrary refoulement and had made thorough assessments, adequately and sufficiently supported by national and international source materials. In the proceedings, the applicant had been given many opportunities to present his case, through interviews conducted by the Board with an interpreter present and by being invited to submit written submissions, at all stages assisted by legal counsel. Moreover, having regard to the expertise held by the migration bodies, the Government maintained that significant weight should be given to their findings.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles29. The Court reiterates that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, for example, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, § 67; Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997‑VI, p. 2264, § 42; and Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006-XII). However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-125, ECHR 2008-...).30. The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assesses the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, § 40).31. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, § 96; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, § 128). It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker’s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007; and Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37913/05, 27 March 2008).32. In cases concerning the expulsion of asylum seekers, the Court does not itself examine the actual asylum applications or verify how the States honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. It must be satisfied, though, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other contracting or non-contracting states, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 119, 17 July 2008).(b) The general situation in Iraq33. The Court notes that a general situation of violence will not normally in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of an expulsion (H.L.R. v. France, cited above, § 41). However, the Court has never excluded the possibility that the general situation of violence in a country of destination may be of a sufficient level of intensity as to entail that any removal to it would necessarily breach Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases of general violence, where there is a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 115).34. While the international reports on Iraq attest to a continued difficult situation, including indiscriminate and deadly attacks by violent groups, discrimination as well as heavy-handed treatment by authorities, it appears that the overall situation is slowly improving. In the case of F.H. v. Sweden (no. 32621/06, § 93, 20 January 2009), the Court, having at its disposal information material upto and including the year 2008, concluded that the general situation in Iraq was not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of a person’s return to that country. Taking into account the international and national reports available today, the Court sees no reason to alter the position taken in this respect four years ago.35. However, the applicant did not only claim that the general situation in Iraq was too unsafe for his return, but also that his status as a member of the Christian minority would put him at real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3.(c) The situation of Christians in Iraq36. In the mentioned case of F.H. v. Sweden, following its conclusion that the general situation in Iraq was not sufficient to preclude all returns to the country, the Court had occasion to examine the risks facing the applicant on account of his being Christian. It concluded then that he would not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment on the basis of his religious affiliation alone. In so doing, the Court had regard to the occurrence of attacks against Christians, some of them deadly, but found that they had been carried out by individuals rather than organised groups and that the applicant would be able to seek protection from the Iraqi authorities who would be willing and able to help him (§ 97 of the judgment).37. During the subsequent four years, attacks on Christians have continued, including the attack on 31 October 2010 on the Catholic church Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad, claiming more than 50 victims. The available evidence rather suggests that, in comparison with 2008/09, such violence has escalated. While still the great majority of civilians killed in Iraq are Muslims, a high number of attacks have been recorded in recent years which appear to have specifically targeted Christians and been conducted by organised extremist groups. As noted by the UNHCR (see M.Y.H. and Others, § 25) and others, Christians form a vulnerable minority in the southern and central parts of Iraq, either directly because of their faith or because of their perceived wealth or connections with foreign forces and countries or the practice of some of them to sell alcohol. The UK Border Agency concluded in December 2011 that the authorities in these parts of the country were generally unable to protect Christians and other religious minorities (M.Y.H. and Others, § 26).38. The question arises whether the vulnerability of the Christian group and the risks which the individuals face on account of their faith make it impossible to return members of this group to Iraq without violating their rights under Article 3. The Court considers, however, that it need not determine this issue, as there is an internal relocation alternative available to them in the Kurdistan Region. This will be examined in the following.(d) The possibility of relocation to the Kurdistan Region39. The Court reiterates that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight or relocation alternative in their assessment of an individual’s claim that a return to the country of origin would expose him or her to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision. However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of ill‑treatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, § 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).40. The three northern governorates – Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah – forming the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, or KRI, are, according to international sources, a relatively safe area. While there have been incidents of violence and threats, the rights of Christians are generally considered to be respected. As noted by various sources, large numbers of Christians have travelled to the Kurdistan Region and found refuge there.41. As regards the possibility of entering the KRI, some sources state that the border checks are often inconsistent, varying not only from governorate to governorate but also from checkpoint to checkpoint (see the UNHCR Guidelines and the Finnish/Swiss report, which appears to rely heavily on the UNHCR’s conclusions in this respect, M.Y.H. and Others, §§ 30 and 35 respectively). However, the difficulties faced by some at the KRI checkpoints do not seem to be relevant for Christians. This has been noted by, among others, the UNHCR. Rather, members of the Christian group are given preferential treatment as compared to others wishing to enter the Kurdistan Region. As stated by a representative of an international organisation and the head of Asaysih, the KRI general security authority, to investigators of the Danish/UK fact-finding mission, this is because Christians are at particular risk of terrorist attacks in southern and central Iraq and as the Christians are not considered to pose any terrorist threat themselves (at 4.34 and 8.19 of the report, M.Y.H. and Others, § 36).42. Moreover, while Christians may be able to enter the three northern governorates without providing any documentation at all (see Danish/UK report, at 4.34), in any event there does not seem to be any difficulty to obtain identity documents in case old ones have been lost. As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, § 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, § 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI. It appears that the UNHCR is of the same opinion as regards entry, although its statement in the Guidelines directly concerns only the requirements of a tourist (M.Y.H. and Others, § 30). The Finnish/Swiss report states that Christians may be able to nominate senior clerics as sponsors (M.Y.H. and Others, § 35); thus, they do not have to have a personal acquaintance to vouch for them.43. Internal relocation inevitably involves certain hardship. Various sources have attested that people who relocate to the Kurdistan Region may face difficulties, for instance, in finding proper jobs and housing there, not the least if they do not speak Kurdish. Nevertheless, the evidence before the Court suggests that there are jobs available and that settlers have access to health care as well as financial and other support from the UNHCR and local authorities. In any event, there is no indication that the general living conditions in the KRI for a Christian settler would be unreasonable or in any way amount to treatment prohibited by Article 3. Nor is there a real risk of his or her ending up in the other parts of Iraq.44. In conclusion, therefore, the Court considers that relocation to the Kurdistan Region is a viable alternative for a Christian fearing persecution or ill-treatment in other parts of Iraq. The reliance by a Contracting State on such an alternative would thus not, in general, give rise to an issue under Article 3.(e) The particular circumstances of the applicant45. It remains for the Court to determine whether, despite what has been stated above, the personal circumstances of the applicant would make it unreasonable for him to settle in the Kurdistan Region. In this respect, the Court first notes that the applicant’s account was examined by the Migration Board and the Migration Court, which both gave extensive reasons for their decisions that he was not in need of protection in Sweden. The applicant was able to present the arguments he wished with the assistance of legal counsel and language interpretation.46. As regards the suffering which the applicant and his family experienced in Iraq, the Court notes, without underestimating their serious nature, that they all occurred in Baghdad. It has not been shown that he would be at risk in the Kurdistan Region, and the applicant’s misgivings as to the possibility for him to settle there are not supported by the information on the KRI available to the Court.47. The Court notes that the applicant’s wife and daughter have been granted permanent residence permits in Sweden and that the wife was expected to give birth to another child in October 2012. The applicant’s deportation would inevitably separate the applicant from his wife and children, at least temporarily, but the applicant may apply for a residence permit based on family ties upon his return to Iraq. It should further be borne in mind that the applicant has not complained, at any stage of the proceedings in the present case, of a violation of his right to respect for his family life. Should a future request for a residence permit based on family ties be rejected by the Swedish authorities, he is free to submit a new application to the Court under Article 8 of the Convention, supplying the Court with all the information necessary for it to examine whether his right under that provision has been respected.(f) Conclusion48. Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that, although the applicant, as Christian, belongs to a vulnerable minority and irrespective of whether he can be said to face, as a member of that group, a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the southern and central parts of Iraq, he may reasonably relocate to the Kurdistan Region, where he will not face such a risk. Neither the general situation in that region, including that of the Christian minority, nor any of the applicant’s personal circumstances indicate the existence of said risk.Consequently, his deportation to Iraq would not involve a violation of Article 3.II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT49. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.50. It considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see § 4 above) must continue in force until the present judgment becomes final or until the Court takes a further decision in this connection (see operative part).FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Declares unanimously the application admissible;2. Holds by five votes to two that the implementation of the deportation order against the applicant would not give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Decides unanimously to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until such time as the present judgment becomes final or until further order.Done in English, and notified in writing on 27 June 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Claudia Westerdiek Mark Villiger Registrar PresidentIn accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge Power-Forde joined by Judge Zupančič is annexed to this judgment.M.V.C.W.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v. Sweden, I voted against the majority in finding that Article 3 would not be breached in the event that the deportation order made in respect of this applicant were to be executed. My dissent was based on the failure of the majority to test whether the requisite guarantees required by the Court’s case law prior to a deportation based on internal flight options, were established in this case.However, apart from that question of principle in relation to internal flight options, I have serious doubts as to whether the applicant’s deportation would, in any event, be in compliance with Article 3 of the Convention.The applicant is a 45-year-old man from Baghdad who was and is an active member of the Syrian Orthodox church. He lived with his wife and two children in Baghdad. He has had a particularly severe history of suffering during the war in Iraq because of his religious belief. In February 2007 his wife received threatening letters warning her to leave her job teaching Arabic at an Iraqi university. His family was required to go into hiding. His son was abducted and strangled and his remains were dumped on a street. The police authorities were informed but little was done. A similar threat was then made on his daughter’s life. Eventually, the applicant and his family fled to Syria in September 2007 and, thereafter, the applicant went to Sweden to seek asylum.In the meantime, and having regard to the deteriorating situation in Syria, the applicant’s wife returned to Baghdad in 2010 in search of work. She was kidnapped, attacked and raped by a group of men. She finally came to Sweden with her daughter where both of them were granted asylum.Clearly, the applicant and his wife and daughter were separated for some time, not least, as a consequence of the legacy of war in their home country. However, it is equally clear that the applicant has since reunited with his wife and daughter and that they have been living together for some time. A third child has been born of their marriage in October 2012.Having regard to what the applicant has already endured—the loss of his home, the death of his son, the flight of his family, the assaults upon his wife, the fracturing of their relationship and the ultimate reunification of his family—the suffering that would be imposed upon him by separating him, once again, from his family and his newborn child and by forcing him to return to Iraq—would, to my mind, cross the threshold of suffering required by Article 3.I appreciate that the applicant’s claim is not brought under Article 8 of the Convention. I also recognise that the threat under Article 3 must be assessed in terms of future risk. However, when assessing future risk one has to have regard to the individual circumstances of each case and to the level of suffering to which an individual has already been exposed. Such previous experience may be sufficient to break a person’s moral or psychological resistance in the event that he or she is further exposed to additional suffering.To my mind, given what this applicant has already endured it would be inhuman and degrading to separate him once again from his immediate family, which he has finally managed to hold together despite the trauma of war. The additional suffering that this would entail would be sufficient, to my mind, to break his moral and psychological resistance and would extend beyond the level permitted by Article 3 of the Convention.The expulsion of a person on the basis that internal flight relocation is available may, in altogether different circumstances, be compatible with Article 3. However, having regard to the circumstances of this applicant’s case, his expulsion to Iraq would not, in my view. be compatible with that Article of the Convention.It is formalistic in the extreme to expect that the applicant should be forced to leave his wife and children, once again, purely for the purposes of travelling to the Kurdish region so that, from there, he may contact a Swedish Embassy and apply for family reunification.Therefore, both for the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in M.Y.H. and Others v Sweden and on the merits of this case, I consider that the applicant’s removal to Iraq would violate Article 3.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v.

The applicant complained, under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, of having contracted TB in prison, of insufficient medical care for his various diseases throughout the entire period of his detention, and of having been deprived of effective remedies in this respect. He further challenged the conditions of his detention in Rustavi nos. 1 and 6 Prisons in the periods between 18 July 2008 and 4 March 2010 and 23 July 2010 up to the present as inadequate. Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention read as follows:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A. Admissibility1. The parties’ arguments22. The Government argued that the complaint about poor conditions of detention was unsubstantiated. In support, they submitted two letters from the Governors of the prison facilities involved, describing in detail the conditions of the applicant’s detention. According to these letters, the applicant was being kept in satisfactory conditions; the sanitary and hygienic norms were met; he was allowed to take a shower at least once a week and had been provided with all basic items of hygiene. In Rustavi no. 1 Prison, an open-type prison, the applicant was allowed six hours’ outdoor exercise on a daily basis, whilst in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a closed institution, he had been allowed at least a one-hour walk per day. On the basis of the relevant service provider contracts, the Government further argued that the food available to the applicant in both establishments was prepared in accordance with the legally approved norms, and that the applicant was regularly provided with the basic items of hygiene. In sum, the conditions of the applicant’s detention were compatible with Article 3.23. As regards the applicant’s alleged infection with TB and the inadequacy of the medical treatment provided to him in prison, the Government submitted that these complaints were premature, as the applicant had neither filed, under the relevant administrative rules, complaints of a lack of medical care in prison, nor sought monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage under the relevant provisions of the General Administrative Code and the Civil Code. In support of the latter argument they submitted a case where the domestic authorities had awarded compensation for the death in detention of the plaintiff’s husband, which had been caused by a lack of appropriate medical treatment. This decision was adopted by the domestic court in the framework of the friendly settlement proceedings in the case of Gamrekelashvili v. Georgia ((dec.) no. 6439/10, 6 September 2011).24. In reply, the applicant reiterated his general allegations about poor conditions of sanitation and hygiene, lack of outdoor exercise, and the diet, without providing any concrete details.25. As regards the medical complaint, the applicant claimed that the administrative-law remedy proposed by the Government was completely ineffective, as it involved extremely time-consuming and inefficient court proceedings. He did not comment on the adequacy of the compensatory remedies suggested by the Government.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Conditions of detention26. The Court notes that information about conditions of detention falls within the knowledge of the domestic authorities. Accordingly, applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Still, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide – to the greatest possible extent – some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no. 32362/02, § 45, 20 May 2010, and Ukhan v. Ukraine, no. 30628/02, § 65, 18 December 2008).27. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the applicant’s allegations were formulated as vague and general statements (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above). While it is aware of the fact that poor conditions of detention constituted a general structural problem in the penal sector in Georgia at the material time (see, amongst others, Janiashvili v. Georgia, no. 35887/05, § 70, 27 November 2012) the Court cannot ignore the simple fact that the applicant failed to provide a detailed account concerning the conditions in which he was held (see, for example, Visloguzov, cited above, §§ 48-49, and Ukhan, cited above, § 65). In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that this part of the application has not been properly substantiated by the applicant (see Shkurenko v. Russia (dec.) no. 15010/04, 10 September 2009). Therefore, it should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.(b) Infection with TB28. As to the alleged infection with TB in prison, the applicant in the current case has never attempted to bring a civil claim for damages for his alleged infection. The Court notes, however, that it has previously examined a similar situation and found that a civil claim for damages under Article 207 of the General Administrative Code and Article 413 of the Civil Code was the most effective remedy to be used (see Goloshvili v. Georgia, no. 45566/08, §§ 24-25 and 32-33, 23 October 2012; see also Jeladze, cited above, § 35). The Court sees no reason to depart from its previous conclusion and considers that this aspect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.(c) Medical treatment29. As to the alleged absence of adequate medical care in prison, the Court reiterates that prior to 1 October 2010, the Georgian law and practice did not provide for an effective legal remedy allowing a claimant to obtain injunctive relief in a situation concerning lack of medical care in prison. Consequently, it was sufficient for an ill detainee, who wished to complain to the Court of a lack of adequate medical care, to have alerted the relevant domestic authorities about his or her state of health (see Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 51-54 and 57; Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above, §§ 53‑55; Goloshvili, cited above, §§ 34-35, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 31-33). In view of the relevant circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the prison authorities were made sufficiently aware of the applicant’s medical situation and had an opportunity to offer redress (see paragraphs 11-14 above). Consequently, having regard to the above case‑law on the subject matter, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion.30. The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment in prison is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. Submissions by the parties31. The Government firstly submitted that the positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention did not encompass an obligation on States to conduct compulsory screening for the presence of tuberculosis. They claimed in this connection that the first time the applicant had voiced his grievances concerning possible infection with TB was in January 2010, and by February 2010 he had been provided with all the required medical examinations and treatment. Hence, the examination for TB was not belated.32. With respect to the anti-tuberculosis treatment itself, the Government argued, relying on the relevant medical reports, that the applicant had been provided with the necessary medical assistance without interruption since his diagnosis was revealed. At the initial stage he had been administered with comprehensive in-patient treatment in the prison hospital and Ksani prison, which had included the relevant tests, repeated consultations with medical specialists, the necessary medication, and so on. Subsequently, the applicant had been transferred to Rustavi no. 1 Prison. The Government explained that this had become possible only after a significant improvement in the applicant’s medical condition. They dismissed the applicant’s allegation according to which Rustavi no. 1 Prison was not capable of providing him with adequate medical care. The Government submitted in this connection a letter dated 18 August 2010 from the Ministry of Prisons, according to which the DOTS programme, which allows for the provision of the relevant anti-tuberculosis drugs to infected prisoners, has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 prison since 10 June 2010.33. The Government also claimed with respect to his other diseases that the applicant had been provided with the requisite medical treatment from the very beginning of his detention. In support, they submitted, as regards the treatment allegedly available in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a letter of the prison Governor dated 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 13 above) and an unnamed and undated one-page extract from a medical file, according to which Finlepsin had been provided to the applicant for his epilepsy. As regards the post-February 2010 period, the Government submitted a copy of the applicant’s full medical file. The relevant excerpts showed, according to the Government, that the applicant had been provided with adequate drug‑based treatment for his epilepsy, chronic bronchitis and other minor ailments. The applicant’s diagnosis of circulatory dystonia had not been confirmed.34. In reply, the applicant reiterated his complaint that the treatment dispensed to him in prison had been inadequate. Notably, he noted that firstly his medical examination, despite repeated medical complaints, had been conducted with substantial delay, which had had a detrimental effect on his medical condition; moreover, his eight-month anti-TB treatment course in Ksani no. 8 Prison had suddenly been interrupted by his unjustified transfer on 23 July 2010 to Rustavi no. 1 Prison, which had not been properly equipped to treat him. Lastly, the applicant vaguely claimed that he had not been treated for the rest of his diseases.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles35. The relevant general principles concerning the adequacy of medical treatment in prisons have been summarised by the Court in the cases of Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 69-70, Jeladze, cited above, §§ 41-42, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 39-40.(b) Application of the principles to the present case36. The Court considers that the applicant’s current complaint could be divided into two periods, before and after the applicant’s diagnosis with TB in February 2010.(i) Before February 201037. The Court notes that the applicant was arrested on 4 October 2007 and put immediately in pre-trial detention. In November 2008 he was diagnosed with, inter alia, chronic bronchitis.38. At this point, the Court would first address the Government’s argument concerning the timing of the applicant’s TB test (see paragraph 31 above). The gravity of the problem of tuberculosis in the Georgian prisons, as well as the role of the above-mentioned screening in minimising the spread of this disease, was already acknowledged by the Court in its case‑law on the matter (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, §§ 103‑105, 3 March 2009; see also, Poghosyan, cited above, § 69, and, mutatis mutandis, Jeladze, cited above, § 44). In the present case the applicant did not have a screening test for tuberculosis during the initial two and a half years of his detention. Even after his diagnosis with chronic bronchitis, his requests for medical assistance were left unnoticed (see paragraphs 11-14 above). The Court finds this negligence on the part of the relevant prison authorities to be incompatible with the general obligation to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis and other contagious diseases in prisons (see Jeladze, cited above, § 44, with further references therein).39. On a more general note, the Court observes that the Government failed to submit any medical evidence concerning the applicant’s medical condition during the initial period of his detention, or the treatment administered to him during that time (see, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, § 70, cited above). Neither the letter of the prison Governor nor the undated one-page extract from a medical file (see paragraphs 13 and 33 above) can serve as a sufficient proof in this case (see Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 42-45).40. That being so, the Government, in the Court’s opinion, have failed in accounting for the detained applicant’s state of health and thus in discharging their part of the burden of proof (see, Jeladze, cited above, § 45 and, Irakli Mindadze, cited above, § 47; see also, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, cited above, § 75). The Court, hence, considers that until February 2010 the applicant was left without appropriate medical care in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.(ii) After February 201041. Turning now to the post-diagnosis period, the Court notes that in early February 2010 the applicant was diagnosed with smear-positive focal pulmonary TB at the stage of infiltration. He was immediately placed on the DOTS programme and started receiving all the required first-line anti‑tuberculosis agents on the premises of Ksani no. 8 Prison. On 21 May 2010 the applicant underwent a bacteriological sputum test which was smear-negative. Subsequently, on 23 July 2010, he was transferred to the medical unit of Rustavi no. 1 Prison, where he began the second phase of his anti-TB treatment.42. The Court notes that the applicant’s transfer to a normal prison took place only after the first-phase anti-tuberculosis treatment had yielded positive results (see paragraphs 18 and 32 above). It further observes, on the basis of the relevant medical evidence, that the applicant’s eight-month treatment was not interrupted but rather continued at Rustavi no. 1 Prison (see paragraph 32 above). Hence, the only issue pending before the Court is to assess whether Rustavi no. 1 Prison was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with the second-phase anti-TB treatment.43. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the DOTS programme has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 Prison since 10 June 2010, whilst the applicant was transferred to that prison on 23 July 2010; secondly, according to the available medical evidence, the applicant has continued to receive second-phase anti-TB drugs in line with the DOTS standards; thirdly, the available medical evidence reveals that the applicant has been under permanent medical supervision since his transfer to Rustavi no.1 Prison, with periodic medical check-ups conducted in the prison hospital. Lastly, the latest bacteriological sputum tests performed on the applicant confirmed the smear-negative results.44. Against this background the Court finds the applicant’s argument concerning the inadequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment administered to him in Rustavi no. 1 Prison unsubstantiated. Whilst acknowledging that there may be advantages to anti-tuberculosis treatment provided on an in‑patient basis, the Court nevertheless concludes, having duly examined the applicant’s medical file, that there are not sufficient grounds for questioning the adequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment provided to the applicant following his diagnosis of February 2010.45. As regards the applicant’s other diseases, the Government submitted his full medical file, from which it appears that he has been placed under permanent medical supervision as far as the period after February 2010 concerns; the applicant’s epilepsy has been under control, as no epileptic seizures have been recorded and he has been provided with the required drug-based treatment for this and other of his medical conditions. The applicant failed to point to any specific inadequacies in this area.46. In view of the above, the Court finds no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to be applicant following his diagnosis of tuberculosis in February 2010.47. In the light of the conclusions reached above (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above), the Court does not consider that it is also necessary to consider this complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION48. The applicant alleged, relying on Article 3 of the Convention, that he had been beaten by unidentified prison officers on an unspecified date in Gldani no. 8 prison. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he also challenged the outcome of the criminal proceedings conducted against him. He maintained, inter alia, that the domestic courts had improperly assessed the circumstances of his case and that, instead of endorsing the incriminating evidence, the courts should have subscribed to his arguments in defence. Invoking Article 13 of the Convention, in conjunction with the above-mentioned provision, the applicant also complained that an application to the Supreme Court was not an effective judicial remedy, as that court had rejected his cassation appeal as inadmissible.49. In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage51. The applicant claimed 950 euros (EUR) in respect of expenses his family had incurred in supporting him in prison and EUR 23 for medicines he had purchased. In addition, he claimed EUR 4,250 in compensation for the expenses his family would have to incur to support him in prison for the remaining seventeen years of his imprisonment. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed EUR 45,000.52. The Government contested these claims, stating that they were groundless.53. The Court rejects as unsubstantiated the costs borne for the medicines. As regards the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged in connection with the applicant’s past and future living expenses in prison; it therefore rejects that claim. However, having regard to its conclusions under Article 3 of the Convention, and making its own assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,500 for non-pecuniary damage.B. Costs and expenses54. The applicant claimed, on the basis of two bank statements, EUR 166 in respect of his representation before the domestic court. He also claimed a total of EUR 66 for postal expenses, without submitting any relevant bills in support.55. The Government argued that this claim was unsubstantiated.56. In the light of its well-established case-law on the matter (see, for instance, Ghavtadze, cited above, §§ 118 and 120 and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, § 164, 27 May 2010), and having due regard to the insufficient documentary evidence in its possession, the Court rejects this claim.C. Default interest57. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY1. Declares the complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention concerning the alleged absence of adequate medical treatment for the applicant in prison and the lack of effective remedies in this regard admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inadequate medical treatment provided to the applicant in prison until February 2010;3. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to the applicant after February 2010;4. Holds that it is not necessary to consider the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;5. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,500 (four thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 23 April 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Santiago Quesada Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2013-04-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-118646', 'appno': '65391/09', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'GEO', 'extractedappno': '65391/09;47729/08;35254/07;1871/08;6439/10;32362/02;30628/02;35887/05;15010/04;45566/08;23204/07;18768/05', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;90;193', 'doc_id': '53d0f9b1-3e7d-44ce-bbbf-2d978647eac5'}, page_content='Jeladze v.

       "[Document(metadata={'Word Count': 2319, 'The Law': '...I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION77. The applicants contended that the police operation at their home had subjected them to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention, which provides:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”78. The applicants complained in particular that the manner in which the police operation had been conducted – before daybreak, by masked and heavily armed police officers who had forced their way in and pointed their weapons at them and had handcuffed Mr Gutsanov while forcing him to kneel down – had subjected them to a severe psychological ordeal amounting to degrading treatment.79. In their written observations of 6 January 2012, the applicants complained of the lack of a criminal investigation into their alleged ill‑treatment during the police operation of 31 March 2010.A. Admissibility1. Complaint concerning the police operation of 31 March 2010(a) The Government’s observations80. The Government submitted that this complaint should be rejected for failure to exhaust domestic remedies and failure to comply with the six‑month time-limit, and because it was premature and the applicants did not have victim status.81. They observed firstly that the criminal investigation against Mr Gutsanov was still pending, with the result that the complaint under Article 3 was premature.82. In the Government’s view, the applicants had not raised their complaint alleging degrading treatment before the competent authorities. Furthermore, they had not lodged an action for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. They had therefore omitted to exhaust the remedies that were normally available and effective under domestic law.83. The Government went on to observe that, in an order of 7 April 2010, the Varna regional public prosecutor’s office had decided not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers who had entered the applicants’ home. The prosecuting authorities had noted, inter alia, that the police officers’ actions had not constituted any criminal offence. They further argued that the actions in question had in no sense been intended to undermine the applicants’ dignity or cause them any psychological harm; accordingly, they did not amount to treatment incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. In the Government’s view, the applicants could not therefore claim to be victims of a violation of their rights under that Article.(b) The applicants’ observations84. The applicants did not dispute the fact that they had not lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers who had entered their home on 31 March 2010. However, they argued that such a remedy would be manifestly ineffective for two reasons in particular. Firstly, no provision of Bulgarian criminal law made it a punishable offence to inflict degrading treatment on others stemming from psychological pressure. Secondly, as the Court had found in a series of cases concerning operations by special officers of the national police force, the authorities’ systematic refusal to reveal the identity of the officers concerned would make any criminal investigation concerning them ineffective.85. The decision not to prosecute issued by the regional public prosecutor’s office in the present case merely confirmed that a criminal complaint would have been ineffective. The public prosecutor had taken the decision not to commence criminal proceedings against the police officers shortly after the file had been opened, on the sole basis of two reports by police officers and without having taken statements from any other witnesses or gathered other evidence. The applicants had not been informed of that decision and had been deprived of any opportunity of being involved in the investigation.86. As to a possible action for damages under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act, the applicants maintained that this could likewise not be regarded as an effective domestic remedy in their case. According to the settled case-law of the domestic courts, section 1 of the Act, under the terms of which the State could be held liable for damage caused as a result of administrative action, was not applicable to action taken by police officers to enforce investigative measures in the context of criminal proceedings, which formed part of the judicial process rather than the performance of administrative duties. Furthermore, in a binding interpretative judgment delivered in 2005, the Supreme Court of Cassation had made clear that where administrative bodies including the police were implementing measures ordered by the judicial authorities, an action for damages against the State could be brought only against the latter and on the basis of section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act. However, section 2 provided for compensation in only a limited number of situations. The only one that could possibly apply in the present case was Mr Gutsanov’s acquittal or the subsequent discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him. However, it would be difficult for the applicants to prove their allegations given that all the witnesses to the events were police officers who had taken part in the operation of 31 March 2010.(c) The Court’s assessment87. The Court observes at the outset that the Government raised several objections of inadmissibility in relation to the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of the parties’ submissions, it considers that the issues of compliance with the six-month time-limit and the allegedly premature nature of the application are closely linked to the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government. It therefore considers it appropriate first of all to determine whether the applicants in the present case complied with the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies.(i) Objection of failure to exhaust domestic remedies88. The Court reiterates that the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies referred to in Article 35 § 1 of the Convention obliges applicants to have exhausted the remedies that are normally available and sufficient in the domestic legal system to enable them to obtain redress for the breaches alleged. The existence of the remedies must be sufficiently certain, in practice as well as in theory, failing which they will lack the requisite accessibility and effectiveness (see, among many other authorities, Salman v. Turkey [GC], no. 21986/93, § 81, ECHR 2000‑VII, and İlhan v. Turkey [GC], no. 22277/93, § 58, ECHR 2000‑VII).89. It is incumbent on the Government claiming non-exhaustion to satisfy the Court that the remedy was an effective one available in theory and in practice at the relevant time. Once that has been demonstrated, it falls to the applicant to establish that the remedy advanced by the Government was in fact exhausted or was for some reason inadequate and ineffective in the particular circumstances of the case or that there existed special circumstances absolving him or her from the requirement (see Akdivar and Others v. Turkey, 16 September 1996, § 68, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996‑IV).90. According to the Court’s established case-law, the remedy normally available in Bulgarian law in respect of inhuman and degrading treatment allegedly caused by police officers is a complaint to the prosecuting authorities (see, among many other authorities, Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria, 28 October 1998, § 86, Reports 1998‑VIII; Osman and Osman v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 43233/98, 6 May 2004; and Kemerov v. Bulgaria (dec.), no. 44041/98, 2 September 2004). The applicants in the present case did not lodge such a complaint with the public prosecutor against the police officers who entered their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They contended in that regard that a complaint to the prosecuting authorities could not be regarded as an effective remedy in their case, in view of the nature of the ill-treatment to which they had been subjected and the deficiency of the domestic criminal-law provisions (see paragraph 84 above).91. The Court observes that in its judgment in Hristovi v. Bulgaria (no. 42697/05, § 95, 11 October 2011), it noted with concern the treatment accorded in Bulgarian criminal law to acts causing psychological suffering. It noted in particular that, with the exception of the very specific case of death threats, the Bulgarian Criminal Code did not provide for the criminalisation of acts by police officers giving rise to this kind of suffering, resulting, for example, from an aggressively conducted search, seizure and arrest operation. Hence, unless a complainant alleged that he or she had sustained physical injury at the hands of the police, the authorities could not be required to commence criminal proceedings in relation to the acts complained of. The Court noted that this deficiency in the criminal law allowed those responsible for inflicting psychological trauma to escape criminal accountability for their actions.92. The applicants in the present case complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of the police operation carried out at their home on the morning of 31 March 2010. They did not claim to have been physically assaulted by the police officers. It therefore appears that if they had lodged a criminal complaint against the police officers in question, the prosecuting authorities would have inevitably refused to institute criminal proceedings because of the same legal deficiency observed by the Court in Hristovi (cited above). It follows that the criminal-law remedy that was normally available and effective in cases of physical violence inflicted by the police was bound from the outset to fail in the particular circumstances complained of by the applicants. The Court cannot therefore criticise them for not having lodged a complaint with the prosecuting authorities against the officers involved in the police operation.93. The Court further observes that in its judgment in Mirosław Garlicki v. Poland (no. 36921/07, § 77, 14 June 2011), it acknowledged that the civil claim for compensation provided for by Polish law in cases of violations of personal rights such as the right to health, liberty, honour and human dignity constituted appropriate redress in respect of the alleged violation of Article 3, in a case in which the applicant complained exclusively of the adverse psychological effects of his arrest by masked officers, which had taken place in front of a large number of people and had subsequently received extensive media coverage. It observes that the applicants in the present case also complained of the psychological effects of the police operation targeting them. The Government contended that the applicants could have lodged a claim for compensation under the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 82 above). However, the Court considers that, in contrast to the case of Mirosław Garlicki (cited above, §§ 77 and 78), where the applicant had available to him several effective domestic remedies, any action for compensation lodged by the four applicants under section 1 or 2 of the above-mentioned Bulgarian Act would have had no prospect of success, for the reasons outlined below.94. The Court points out in this regard that section 1 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act allows individuals to bring proceedings in tort against the State on account of unlawful decisions, acts or omissions of State authorities or officials in the performance of their administrative duties. According to the settled case-law of the highest courts in Bulgaria, acts performed by the investigating and prosecuting authorities in the context of criminal proceedings do not form part of their administrative duties and thus do not come within the ambit of section 1 of the above-mentioned Act (see paragraph 67 above and Iliya Stefanov, cited above, § 28). The Court observes that the police operation at the applicants’ home was carried out in the context of criminal proceedings and was aimed at arresting Mr Gutsanov and searching his home for evidence. Hence, according to the case-law of the domestic courts, the operation formed part of the investigative measures taken in the course of those proceedings and did not engage the State’s liability in tort under section 1 of the above-mentioned Act.95. As regards the applicability of section 2 of the same Act, the Court observes that the only situations that might have been applicable in the circumstances of the case were a finding that Mr Gutsanov’s detention was unlawful and the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against him or his acquittal at first instance or on appeal (see paragraph 67 above). However, the Court notes that the courts to which Mr Gutsanov applied for release found his detention to be in accordance with domestic law ... It further notes that, according to the latest information received by the first applicant, the criminal proceedings in question are still pending at the preliminary investigation stage ... In these circumstances, an action under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act as in force at the relevant time would have been bound to fail.96. The Court also notes that any action lodged under section 2 of the above-mentioned Act in the event of the discontinuance of the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov or his acquittal would not have amounted to express or tacit acknowledgment of the breach of his right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. Any such action would have had to establish that the damage in question had occurred as a result of charges being brought for a criminal offence in proceedings which were subsequently discontinued or ended in an acquittal. Accordingly, the examination of the facts by the domestic courts would have been confined to purely formal findings and would not have encompassed the actual substance of the applicants’ complaints, namely what they saw as the unnecessary nature of the methods employed by the police in order to achieve the objective of the operation, and the adverse psychological effects of the law-enforcement operation on the four applicants.97. In sum, the Court considers that, because of the deficiencies in the domestic legislation, neither the criminal complaint nor the action for damages against the State referred to by the Government would have constituted sufficiently effective domestic remedies in the instant case. The criminal remedy would have been bound to fail because of the absence of any provisions in Bulgarian law making it an offence to inflict psychological suffering (see paragraphs 90-92 above), while an action for compensation against the State would have been ineffective because of the limited scope of the domestic courts’ review in the context of such proceedings (see paragraphs 94-96 above). The Government did not refer to any other remedy capable of affording redress to the applicants for the alleged violation of their rights under Article 3 of the Convention. In view of these considerations and of the arguments outlined above, the Court considers that the Government’s rejection of non-exhaustion should be rejected.(ii) Compliance with the other conditions of admissibility98. The Government also maintained that the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention had been lodged prematurely as the preliminary investigation concerning Mr Gutsanov was still pending. The Court can discern no direct link between the criminal proceedings to which the Government referred and the applicants’ complaint: the proceedings in question are not designed to establish whether the agents of the State safeguarded the applicants’ physical well-being or dignity, but rather to ascertain whether Mr Gutsanov was guilty of conspiracy and of various other criminal offences linked to his position as chairman of Varna municipal council ...99. Even assuming that the Government expect the criminal proceedings to be discontinued or Mr Gutsanov to be acquitted, which would allow him to lodge a claim for damages under section 2 of the State and Municipalities Responsibility for Damage Act (see paragraph 95 above), the Court reiterates that an action of this kind could not lead to a finding of a violation of the applicants’ right not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment during the police operation at their home (see paragraph 96 above). In view of these considerations, the Court cannot criticise the applicants for having applied to it before the criminal proceedings against Mr Gutsanov were concluded. It follows that the present complaint is not premature and that the Government’s preliminary objection should be rejected.100. The Government also contended that the applicants had not complied with the six-month time-limit laid down by Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. The Court reiterates that the six-month rule is closely linked to the rule of exhaustion of domestic remedies, as the six-month period runs from the date of the decision considered as final for the purposes of exhaustion of domestic remedies (see, among other authorities, Edwards v. the United Kingdom (dec.), no. 46477/99, 7 June 2001). Nevertheless, where no adequate remedy is available in domestic law, the six-month period in principle starts to run from the date on which the act complained of took place (see Gongadze v. Ukraine, no. 34056/02, § 155, ECHR 2005‑XI).101. In examining the objection of non-exhaustion raised by the Government, the Court noted that none of the remedies they referred to satisfied the effectiveness requirement under Article 35 § 1 of the Convention. Thus, in the present case, the start of the six-month period should be the date of the events giving rise to the complaint under Article 3, that is to say 31 March 2010. As the applicants lodged their application on 21 May 2010, the Court notes that the six-month time-limit for lodging an application with it was complied with in the instant case. The objection as to inadmissibility raised in this regard must therefore also be rejected.102. Lastly, the Government disputed the applicants’ victim status, arguing that they had not been subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. The Court considers that this objection should be joined to the examination of the merits of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention. It notes that this complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention and that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.2. Complaint concerning the lack of a criminal investigation into the events103. The Court observes that the applicants raised this complaint in their written observations of 6 January 2012. In examining the admissibility of their application under the substantive aspect of Article 3, however, it noted that any criminal complaint seeking the opening of an investigation into the events would be bound to fail from the outset in view of the absence of any provision in domestic law laying down criminal penalties in respect of acts committed by police officers which cause psychological suffering (see paragraph 92 above); this argument was, moreover, advanced by the applicants themselves (see paragraph 84 above).104. The Court reiterates that, according to its settled case-law, the starting-point of the six-month period for lodging an application with it is the date on which the act complained of occurred, where domestic law does not afford appropriate remedies (see paragraph 100 above). It therefore considers that, in the present case, the six-month period for lodging an application under the procedural limb of Article 3 started on 31 March 2010. The applicants formulated their complaint one year and nine months later. It follows that this complaint was submitted out of time and must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.B. Merits1. The parties’ submissions(a) The applicants105. The applicants submitted that the manner in which the police operation at their home had been carried out was incompatible with Article 3 of the Convention. On 31 March 2010, before dawn, a group of masked and heavily armed police officers had forced their way into their house without prior authorisation. The special officers had entered Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi’s bedroom and pointed their weapons at the couple’s two minor daughters. Mr Gutsanov, an influential and respected politician, had been forced to kneel down and been handcuffed.106. In the applicants’ view, there had been no reason for the police operation to be planned and carried out in this manner, in particular as Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi were respectable people who were well known in the city. Neither of them had a criminal record and there had been no reason to suppose that they would offer resistance to the law-enforcement officers. The search of their home did not constitute an urgent investigative measure under Article 161 § 2 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. According to the applicants, all these elements pointed to a real intention to intimidate them, undermine their dignity and induce a feeling of powerlessness in the face of the actions of the law-enforcement officers.107. The police officers’ actions had had an adverse psychological impact on the applicants. In particular, Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, aged five and seven, had been subjected to considerable psychological pressure, as noted by the psychiatrists who had examined them shortly after the events in issue. Mr Gutsanov, a respected politician belonging to an opposition political party, had been the victim of a brutal arrest which had been widely covered in the media and which, together with the arrests of other politicians, formed part of a propaganda campaign by the ruling party. The psychological effects of the treatment complained of had been sufficiently severe to exceed the threshold required by Article 3 and for the treatment in question to be characterised as “degrading”.(b) The Government108. The Government contested the applicants’ allegations and their version of events. They submitted that the police operation of 31 March 2010 had been planned meticulously and carried out in a way which respected the applicants’ dignity and their rights. Mr Gutsanov’s arrest and the search of his home had been carried out in the context of a criminal investigation into serious offences involving several suspected accomplices. The police had been informed that Mr Gutsanov kept a gun in his home.109. The police operation had been launched after sunrise, that is to say after 6 a.m. The police had knocked on the gate of the applicants’ property, announced their presence and requested that the metal gate be opened. The security guard had opened the gate but explained that he did not have a key to the front door of the house. The police had run towards the door and knocked on it, demanding that it be opened immediately. Mr Gutsanov had appeared twice at the window of the house; he had seen and identified the police by their uniforms but had not come down to open the door. At that point, fearing that he might destroy evidence, fetch his firearm or try to escape, the special officers had forced open the door of the house. They had apprehended Mr Gutsanov on the second floor while he was trying to enter a bedroom where his wife and two children were.110. According to the Government, Mr Gutsanov had not been forced to kneel down. The officers had placed the handcuffs on him without using special immobilisation techniques and they had not pointed their weapons at his wife and daughters. The only officer who had gone into the bedroom on the second floor had been carrying only an electric stun gun and had not addressed the children or Mrs Gutsanova. The special officers had stayed in the house for only a few minutes and had left the premises after Mr Gutsanov’s arrest. Shortly afterwards, the applicant’s handcuffs had been removed.111. The police officers’ actions had complied with domestic law. The search had been approved by a judge within twenty-four hours of being carried out and the regional public prosecutor’s office, on the basis of the information supplied by the authorities, had found that the police officers had not committed any criminal offence.112. The Government conceded that the entry of the police into their home, and the search of the house, had undoubtedly aroused negative feelings in the applicants. However, they submitted that these were the normal and inevitable consequence of this kind of investigative measure; hence, the unpleasantness caused had not exceeded the threshold of severity beyond which Article 3 of the Convention applied. This was borne out, for instance, by the fact that the elder of the two girls had been taken to school as usual. The Government also maintained that if Mr Gutsanov had opened the front door of the house, the police officers would not have needed to resort to special measures to enter his home, which would have spared the members of his family the unpleasantness they had experienced.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Establishment of the facts113. The Court reiterates that allegations of ill-treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention must be supported by appropriate evidence. To establish the facts, the Court applies the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 161 in fine, Series A no. 25). However, such proof may follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact (see Salman, cited above, § 100).114. The Court notes that the events surrounding the police operation at the home of the four applicants were not the subject of any review by the domestic courts. When faced with similar situations, the Court has carried out its own assessment of the facts while complying with the rules laid down by its own case-law (see, by way of example, Sashov and Others v. Bulgaria, no. 14383/03, § 48, 7 January 2010).115. On the basis of these principles, the Court deems it appropriate to take as the starting-point of its analysis the circumstances not disputed between the parties and the evidence adduced by them. It will also take into account those allegations by the parties which are sufficiently corroborated by the undisputed facts and the evidence adduced.116. It is not disputed between the parties that the police operation at the applicants’ home began shortly after 6.30 a.m. on 31 March 2010. The footage from the property’s CCTV cameras made available to the Court, and the weather report from the Varna meteorological service, corroborated the applicants’ allegation that the operation took place before sunrise, mainly around dawn (see paragraphs 20 and 21 above).117. The parties also agree that the police operations team was made up of uniformed officers, plain clothes officers and special officers who were armed and masked. The video footage submitted by the applicants (see paragraph 21 above) and the reports submitted by the Government (see paragraphs 22, 24 and 27 above) corroborate this.118. The fact that there was a firearm and ammunition in the applicants’ home is also undisputed and is established by the search report. It is clear from the Government’s observations and the reports they submitted that the police officers had been alerted by their superior officers to the presence of the weapon (see paragraphs 23 and 27 above).119. It is also common ground between the parties that the gate to the applicants’ property was opened voluntarily by the security guard at the request of the police officers (see paragraphs 13 and 24 above). Moreover, the scene was filmed and recorded by the property’s CCTV system (see paragraph 21 above). The parties also agree that the security guard informed the police officers of the identity of those present in the house and the fact that he did not have a key to the front door, and that the door was forced by the special officers who entered the house and arrested Mr Gutsanov (see paragraphs 13, 14, 24 and 25 above).120. Neither of the parties disputes the fact that the applicants were not physically injured during the police operation. The certificates attesting to the psychiatric examinations carried out on Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters (see paragraphs 30 and 31 above) were not disputed by the Government.121. The first discrepancy between the parties’ version of events concerns the description of Mr Gutsanov’s conduct. According to the Government, he appeared twice at one of the windows of the house, saw the police officers and heard their calls but did not open the front door (see paragraph 25 above). The first applicant, meanwhile, stated that he had not realised that it was a police operation until the special officers entered the house and began to climb the stairs (see paragraph 16 above).122. The evidence available to the Court does not enable it to determine whether the applicant did actually appear at the window of his house and deliberately refused to open the front door to the police officers. However, it notes that it is not disputed that the police officers knocked at the front gate of the property and announced their presence to the security guard by calling out. According to the police officers, they then knocked on the front door of the house and called out “Police! Open up!”. This assertion is corroborated by the statements made by Mr and Mrs Gutsanovi, according to which they were woken by shouts and knocking at the door of the house (see paragraph 15 above). Mr Gutsanov stated that he had gone down to the first floor of the house to fetch the two children before going back up to the bedroom on the second floor. This claim was corroborated by the version of the police officers who saw the outline of a man through the windows of the house (see paragraph 25 above).123. As to the exact place in which Mr Gutsanov was arrested, the Court observes that he himself admitted in his statement that when the police officers forced the door and issued verbal warnings, he had run up to the bedroom on the second floor where his wife and children were (see paragraph 16 above). The Court is not in a position to determine whether Mr Gutsanov was arrested inside the bedroom on the second floor of the house, as he claimed, or on the second-floor landing after he had come out of the bedroom of his own volition, as claimed by the Government. Nor has it been established beyond any reasonable doubt that the police officers spoke to Mrs Gutsanova and asked her to cover the children with the duvet. In any event the Court observes that, according to the witness evidence given by the special officers (see paragraphs 25 and 27 above), they saw Mr Gutsanov’s wife and children inside the bedroom when they went up to the second floor of the house in pursuit of Mr Gutsanov. The Court accepts that Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters also saw the armed and masked men, if only through the bedroom door.124. In the Court’s view, Mr Gutsanov’s claim that he was forced to kneel down so that the police officers could place the handcuffs on him has not been proved beyond all reasonable doubt. As regards the handcuffing, it is not disputed that the special officers placed handcuffs on Mr Gutsanov downstairs (see paragraph 16 above). However, the Court observes that neither of the parties specified the length of time for which Mr Gutsanov remained in handcuffs. In any event, it cannot but observe that there is no evidence in the file to demonstrate that the first applicant was made to appear in handcuffs before the cameras of the journalists who had gathered outside the entrance to the property that day. Furthermore, the photograph taken as he was leaving the house, at around 1 p.m., shows no signs of him being handcuffed ... Accordingly, the Court considers that the present case falls to be distinguished in that regard from the case of Mirosław Garlicki, (cited above, § 75), in which the applicant was arrested at his workplace in front of his colleagues and patients, placed in handcuffs and filmed.(b) Compliance with Article 3 in the instant case125. The Court reiterates that ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this minimum is relative: it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical and mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim. Treatment has been held by the Court to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering, and also “degrading” because it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000‑IV). Psychological suffering may result from a situation in which State agents deliberately instil fear in individuals by threatening to kill or ill-treat them (see Hristovi, cited above, § 80).126. Article 3 does not prohibit the use of force by police officers during an arrest. Nevertheless, the use of force must be proportionate and absolutely necessary in the circumstances of the case (see, among many other authorities, Rehbock v. Slovenia, no. 29462/95, § 76, ECHR 2000‑XII, and Altay v. Turkey, no. 22279/93, § 54, 22 May 2001). In this regard, it is of importance for instance whether there is reason to believe that the person concerned would resist arrest or abscond, cause injury or damage or suppress evidence (see Raninen v. Finland, 16 December 1997, § 56, Reports 1997‑VIII). The Court reiterates in particular that any recourse by agents of the State to physical force against a person which has not been made strictly necessary by his or her own conduct diminishes human dignity and is in principle an infringement of the right set forth in Article 3 (see Rachwalski and Ferenc v. Poland, no. 47709/99, § 59, 28 July 2009). This strict proportionality test has also been applied by the Court in situations where the individuals concerned were already in the hands of the law‑enforcement agencies (see, among other authorities, Klaas v. Germany, 22 September 1993, § 30, Series A no. 269; Rehbock, cited above, §§ 68-78; and Milan v. France, no. 7549/03, §§ 52-65, 24 January 2008).127. Turning to the facts of the present case, the Court observes that the operation pursued the legitimate aim of carrying out an arrest, a search and a seizure of items as well as the public-interest objective of prosecuting criminal offences. The Court must be satisfied that a fair balance was struck in the circumstances of the case between the demands of the general interest and the requirements of the protection of the individual’s fundamental rights. It notes that, although the four applicants were not physically injured in the course of the impugned police operation, the latter necessarily entailed a degree of physical force. The front door of the house was forced open by the special operations team, Mr Gutsanov was immobilised by masked armed officers, led downstairs by force and handcuffed. The Court must therefore establish whether this use of physical force was proportionate and absolutely necessary in the instant case.128. The aim of the police operation at the applicants’ home that day was to arrest Mr Gutsanov, who was a suspect in a criminal case concerning misappropriation of public funds, and to carry out a search of the premises to look for physical and documentary evidence in the context of the same criminal investigation. It emerges from the evidence in the file that the investigation in question had been opened five months previously, that there were several suspects in the case and that the authorities suspected the existence of a conspiracy (see paragraph 9 ... above). The case clearly did not concern a group of individuals suspected of committing violent criminal acts.129. With regard to Mr Gutsanov’s personality, the Court observes that he was a well-known political figure in Varna: at the material time he was Chairman of the city’s municipal council. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the file to suggest that he had a history of violence or that he might have presented a danger to the police officers conducting the operation at his home.130. It is true that Mr Gutsanov was the lawful owner of a firearm and ammunition which he kept at his home. This fact was known to the police and had been specifically mentioned at the briefing of the police team before the operation (see paragraph 23 above). This was undoubtedly a relevant factor which had to be taken into account by the officers during the operation at the applicants’ home. However, the Court considers that the presence of the weapon in the applicants’ home was not sufficient in itself to justify the deployment of a special operations team or the degree of force that was used in the instant case.131. It is clear from the file that the possible presence of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and minor children was not taken into consideration at any stage in planning and carrying out the police operation. The fact was not mentioned during the pre-operation briefing (see paragraph 23 above) and the police officers apparently paid no heed to the warning by the security guard that young children were present in the house (see paragraph 24 above).132. Of course, the Court cannot go so far as to require the law‑enforcement agencies not to arrest persons suspected of criminal offences in their homes whenever their children or spouses are present. However, it considers that the possible presence of family members at the scene of an arrest is a circumstance that must be taken into consideration in planning and carrying out this type of police operation. This was not done in the present case and the law-enforcement agencies did not contemplate any alternative means of carrying out the operation at the applicants’ home, such as staging the operation at a later hour or even deploying a different type of officer in the operation. Consideration of the legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her daughters was especially necessary since the former was not under suspicion of involvement in the criminal offences of which her husband was suspected, and her two daughters were psychologically vulnerable because they were so young (five and seven years of age).133. The Court also observes that the lack of prior judicial review of the necessity and lawfulness of the search left the planning of the operation entirely at the discretion of the police and the criminal investigation bodies and did not enable the rights and legitimate interests of Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters to be taken into consideration. In the Court’s view, such prior judicial review, in the specific circumstances of the present case, would have enabled their legitimate interests to be weighed against the public-interest objective of arresting persons suspected of committing a criminal offence.134. As regards the psychological effects of the police operation on the applicants, the Court observes that police operations which entail intervention in the home and the arrest of suspects inevitably arouse negative emotions in the persons targeted. However, in the present case, there is concrete, undisputed evidence that Mrs Gutsanova and her two minor daughters were very severely affected by the events. Mrs Gutsanova consulted a psychiatrist on two occasions complaining of insomnia and acute anxiety and was prescribed tranquillisers (see paragraph 31 above). The two girls were also examined by a psychiatrist who observed that, when recalling the events, they reacted by crying or displaying acute anxiety (see paragraph 30 above). Mrs Gutsanova stated that her younger daughter, B., had started stammering again (see paragraph 28 above). As for S., the couple’s elder daughter, the statements by her aunt and her schoolteacher indicated that she had been deeply affected by the police operation at her home and by her father’s arrest (see paragraph 29 above). The Court also considers that the fact that the police operation took place in the early morning and involved special officers wearing masks, who were seen by Mrs Gutsanova and her two daughters, served to heighten the feelings of fear and anxiety experienced by these three applicants, to the extent that the treatment to which they were subjected exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 of the Convention to apply. The Court therefore considers that these three applicants were subjected to degrading treatment.135. As regards the adverse psychological effects of the police operation on Mr Gutsanov, the Court cannot but observe that the first applicant did not produce any medical evidence to this effect. Nevertheless, he stated that the humiliation and anxiety he had experienced during the heavy-handed operation to arrest him, in front of the members of his family, had been sufficiently intense for Article 3 to apply in his case (see paragraph 107 above).136. The Court reiterates its findings to the effect that the police operation in question was planned and carried out without regard for a number of relevant factors such as the nature of the criminal offences of which Mr Gutsanov was suspected, the fact that he had no history of violence, and the possible presence of his wife and daughters in the family home. All these elements point clearly to the excessive nature of the deployment of special officers and special procedures in order to arrest the first applicant and enable the police to enter his home. The Court considers that, in the light of these circumstances, the manner in which Mr Gutsanov’s arrest was carried out – very early in the morning, by several armed and masked officers who forced their way in through the door of the house, and under the frightened gaze of Mr Gutsanov’s wife and two young daughters – aroused strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness in the first applicant, capable of humiliating and debasing him in his own eyes and in the eyes of his close relatives. The Court considers that the intensity of these feelings exceeded the threshold of severity required for Article 3 to apply. Accordingly, Mr Gutsanov too was subjected to degrading treatment.137. In conclusion, having taken into account all the relevant circumstances in the present case, the Court considers that the police operation at the applicants’ home was not planned and carried out in such a way as to ensure that the means employed were strictly necessary in order to attain the ultimate objectives of arresting a person suspected of committing criminal offences and gathering evidence in the context of a criminal investigation. The four applicants were subjected to a psychological ordeal which aroused in them strong feelings of fear, anguish and powerlessness and which, on account of its adverse effects, amounted to degrading treatment for the purposes of Article 3. There has therefore been a violation of that provision in the present case....FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Decides to join to the merits the Government’s objection regarding the applicants’ victim status in respect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention;2. Declares, unanimously, the complaints concerning Article 3 admissible ...;3. Holds, unanimously, that there has been a violation of Article 3 in respect of the four applicants;...Done in French, and notified in writing on 15 October 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Françoise Elens-Passos Ineta Ziemele Registrar President...', 'date': Timestamp('2013-10-15 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-126982', 'appno': '34529/10', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'BGR', 'extractedappno': '34529/10;26966/10;30336/10;37124/10;44885/10;45773/10;55388/10;65755/01;68294/01;73481/01;21986/93;22277/93;43233/98;44041/98;42697/05;36921/07;46477/99;34056/02;14383/03;26772/95;29462/95;22279/93;47709/99;7549/03', 'conclusion': 'Preliminary objection joined to merits (Article 34 - Victim);Remainder inadmissible;Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment) (Substantive aspect);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Brought promptly before judge or other officer);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-3 - Length of pre-trial detention;Reasonableness of pre-trial detention);Violation of Article 5 - Right to liberty and security (Article 5-5 - Compensation);No violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence);Violation of Article 6 - Right to a fair trial (Article 6 - Criminal proceedings;Article 6-2 - Presumption of innocence);Violation of Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life (Article 8-1 - Respect for home);Violation of Article 13+3 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Prohibition of torture);Violation of Article 13+8 - Right to an effective remedy (Article 13 - Effective remedy) (Article 8-1 - Respect for home;Article 8 - Right to respect for private and family life);Non-pecuniary damage - award', 'importance': 1, 'kpthesaurus': '350;90;448;30;227;404;45;445;76;325;451;426;319;556;444;110;183;498;14;128;216;238', 'doc_id': 'c375fdae-1b0d-4448-8a98-076d9368d89e'}, page_content='as unlawful; and execution of a sentence exceeding the initial length or amount (see also Iliya Stefanov v.

       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 1200, 'The Law': 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION19. The applicant complained that his return to Iraq would involve a violation of Article 3 of the Convention. This provision reads as follows:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”A. Admissibility20. The Court notes that the complaint is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. No other ground for declaring it inadmissible has been invoked or established. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. The submissions of the parties(a) The applicant21. The applicant claimed that, should he be returned to Baghdad or other parts of Iraq, he would face a real risk of being subjected to torture or other inhuman or degrading treatment. He pointed out that the Christian minority was still in a vulnerable position in southern and central Iraq and that the authorities there could not guarantee the safety for Christians.22. The applicant referred to his statements made during the Swedish asylum proceedings. In his view, he had shown that he had been and further risked personal persecution and attacks due to his belonging to the Christian minority. He added that, while he had not been in Iraq since 2007, there was no indication that the threats against him were no longer relevant.23. As regards internal relocation, the applicant submitted that the security situation in the Kurdistan Region had recently deteriorated. He also maintained that a reference person was required in order to settle in that region. He had no family or relatives there, and would thus not be able to present a reference to the Kurdish authorities. Consequently, relocation to the Kurdistan Region was neither possible nor reasonable for him.24. The applicant also mentioned that, while he had been separated from and in conflict with his wife, they had recently reunited (thus, in early 2012) and were planning to live together.(b) The Government25. The Government acknowledged that country-of-origin information showed that the general security situation in the southern and central parts of Iraq was still serious and that Christians was one of the more exposed groups. Furthermore, recent information suggested that professionals such as academics, judges and lawyers, doctors and other medical personnel as well as athletes had been prime targets for various extremist groups. However, the Government maintained that there was no general need of protection for all Christians or for all members of other groups in Iraq and, that, consequently, assessments of protection needs should be made on an individual basis.26. As to the applicant’s personal situation, the Government submitted that the applicant had failed to substantiate that there was a connection between the threats he had received from the Mujahedin and the kidnapping of his son, on the one hand, and the threats and assaults to which his wife had been subjected, on the other. Taking into account also the five years that had passed since the applicant had left Iraq, the Government considered that it had not been established that he would run a personal risk of ill-treatment if returned to Iraq.27. In any event, referring to international reports on Iraq as well as information obtained from the Migration Board, the Government contended that there was an internal flight alternative for the applicant in the three northern governorates of the Kurdistan Region. Allegedly, he would be able to enter without any restrictions or sponsor requirements into this region, which had been identified as the safest and most stable in Iraq, and he would be able to settle there, with access to the same public services as other residents. As to the applicant’s personal circumstances in relation to the possibility to relocate internally, the Government stressed that he is an adult man, born in 1968, and that no information had emerged about his health or any other circumstances that indicated that he was not fit for work. Thus, he would be able to provide for himself, even in an area of Iraq where he lacked a social network.28. The Government further asserted that the Migration Board and the courts had provided the applicant with effective guarantees against arbitrary refoulement and had made thorough assessments, adequately and sufficiently supported by national and international source materials. In the proceedings, the applicant had been given many opportunities to present his case, through interviews conducted by the Board with an interpreter present and by being invited to submit written submissions, at all stages assisted by legal counsel. Moreover, having regard to the expertise held by the migration bodies, the Government maintained that significant weight should be given to their findings.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles29. The Court reiterates that Contracting States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations, including the Convention, to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see, for example, Abdulaziz, Cabales and Balkandali v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 28 May 1985, Series A no. 94, p. 34, § 67; Boujlifa v. France, judgment of 21 October 1997, Reports 1997‑VI, p. 2264, § 42; and Üner v. the Netherlands [GC], no. 46410/99, § 54, ECHR 2006-XII). However, the expulsion of an alien by a Contracting State may give rise to an issue under Article 3, and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if deported, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country. In these circumstances, Article 3 implies the obligation not to deport the person in question to that country (see, among other authorities, Saadi v. Italy [GC], no. 37201/06, §§ 124-125, ECHR 2008-...).30. The assessment of whether there are substantial grounds for believing that the applicant faces such a real risk inevitably requires that the Court assesses the conditions in the receiving country against the standards of Article 3 of the Convention (Mamatkulov and Askarov v. Turkey [GC], nos. 46827/99 and 46951/99, § 67, ECHR 2005-I). These standards imply that the ill-treatment the applicant alleges he will face if returned must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3. The assessment of this is relative, depending on all the circumstances of the case (Hilal v. the United Kingdom, no. 45276/99, § 60, ECHR 2001-II). Owing to the absolute character of the right guaranteed, Article 3 of the Convention may also apply where the danger emanates from persons or groups of persons who are not public officials. However, it must be shown that the risk is real and that the authorities of the receiving State are not able to obviate the risk by providing appropriate protection (H.L.R. v. France, judgment of 29 April 1997, Reports 1997-III, § 40).31. The assessment of the existence of a real risk must necessarily be a rigorous one (Chahal v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 15 November 1996, Reports 1996-V, § 96; and Saadi v. Italy, cited above, § 128). It is in principle for the applicant to adduce evidence capable of proving that there are substantial grounds for believing that, if the measure complained of were to be implemented, he would be exposed to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3. In this respect, the Court acknowledges that, owing to the special situation in which asylum seekers often find themselves, it is frequently necessary to give them the benefit of the doubt when it comes to assessing the credibility of their statements and the documents submitted in support thereof. However, when information is presented which gives strong reasons to question the veracity of an asylum seeker’s submissions, the individual must provide a satisfactory explanation for the alleged discrepancies (see, among other authorities, Collins and Akaziebie v. Sweden (dec.), no. 23944/05, 8 March 2007; and Hakizimana v. Sweden (dec.), no. 37913/05, 27 March 2008).32. In cases concerning the expulsion of asylum seekers, the Court does not itself examine the actual asylum applications or verify how the States honour their obligations under the Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees. It must be satisfied, though, that the assessment made by the authorities of the Contracting State is adequate and sufficiently supported by domestic materials as well as by materials originating from other reliable and objective sources such as, for instance, other contracting or non-contracting states, agencies of the United Nations and reputable non-governmental organisations (NA. v. the United Kingdom, no. 25904/07, § 119, 17 July 2008).(b) The general situation in Iraq33. The Court notes that a general situation of violence will not normally in itself entail a violation of Article 3 in the event of an expulsion (H.L.R. v. France, cited above, § 41). However, the Court has never excluded the possibility that the general situation of violence in a country of destination may be of a sufficient level of intensity as to entail that any removal to it would necessarily breach Article 3 of the Convention. Nevertheless, the Court would adopt such an approach only in the most extreme cases of general violence, where there is a real risk of ill-treatment simply by virtue of an individual being exposed to such violence on return (NA. v. the United Kingdom, cited above, § 115).34. While the international reports on Iraq attest to a continued difficult situation, including indiscriminate and deadly attacks by violent groups, discrimination as well as heavy-handed treatment by authorities, it appears that the overall situation is slowly improving. In the case of F.H. v. Sweden (no. 32621/06, § 93, 20 January 2009), the Court, having at its disposal information material upto and including the year 2008, concluded that the general situation in Iraq was not so serious as to cause, by itself, a violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the event of a person’s return to that country. Taking into account the international and national reports available today, the Court sees no reason to alter the position taken in this respect four years ago.35. However, the applicant did not only claim that the general situation in Iraq was too unsafe for his return, but also that his status as a member of the Christian minority would put him at real risk of being subjected to treatment prohibited by Article 3.(c) The situation of Christians in Iraq36. In the mentioned case of F.H. v. Sweden, following its conclusion that the general situation in Iraq was not sufficient to preclude all returns to the country, the Court had occasion to examine the risks facing the applicant on account of his being Christian. It concluded then that he would not face a real risk of persecution or ill-treatment on the basis of his religious affiliation alone. In so doing, the Court had regard to the occurrence of attacks against Christians, some of them deadly, but found that they had been carried out by individuals rather than organised groups and that the applicant would be able to seek protection from the Iraqi authorities who would be willing and able to help him (§ 97 of the judgment).37. During the subsequent four years, attacks on Christians have continued, including the attack on 31 October 2010 on the Catholic church Our Lady of Salvation in Baghdad, claiming more than 50 victims. The available evidence rather suggests that, in comparison with 2008/09, such violence has escalated. While still the great majority of civilians killed in Iraq are Muslims, a high number of attacks have been recorded in recent years which appear to have specifically targeted Christians and been conducted by organised extremist groups. As noted by the UNHCR (see M.Y.H. and Others, § 25) and others, Christians form a vulnerable minority in the southern and central parts of Iraq, either directly because of their faith or because of their perceived wealth or connections with foreign forces and countries or the practice of some of them to sell alcohol. The UK Border Agency concluded in December 2011 that the authorities in these parts of the country were generally unable to protect Christians and other religious minorities (M.Y.H. and Others, § 26).38. The question arises whether the vulnerability of the Christian group and the risks which the individuals face on account of their faith make it impossible to return members of this group to Iraq without violating their rights under Article 3. The Court considers, however, that it need not determine this issue, as there is an internal relocation alternative available to them in the Kurdistan Region. This will be examined in the following.(d) The possibility of relocation to the Kurdistan Region39. The Court reiterates that Article 3 does not, as such, preclude Contracting States from placing reliance on the existence of an internal flight or relocation alternative in their assessment of an individual’s claim that a return to the country of origin would expose him or her to a real risk of being subjected to treatment proscribed by that provision. However, the Court has held that reliance on such an alternative does not affect the responsibility of the expelling Contracting State to ensure that the applicant is not, as a result of its decision to expel, exposed to treatment contrary to Article 3. Therefore, as a precondition of relying on an internal flight or relocation alternative, certain guarantees have to be in place: the person to be expelled must be able to travel to the area concerned, gain admittance and settle there, failing which an issue under Article 3 may arise, the more so if in the absence of such guarantees there is a possibility of his or her ending up in a part of the country of origin where there is a real risk of ill‑treatment (Sufi and Elmi v. the United Kingdom, nos. 8319/07 and 11449/07, § 266, 28 June 2011, with further references).40. The three northern governorates – Dahuk, Erbil and Sulaymaniyah – forming the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, or KRI, are, according to international sources, a relatively safe area. While there have been incidents of violence and threats, the rights of Christians are generally considered to be respected. As noted by various sources, large numbers of Christians have travelled to the Kurdistan Region and found refuge there.41. As regards the possibility of entering the KRI, some sources state that the border checks are often inconsistent, varying not only from governorate to governorate but also from checkpoint to checkpoint (see the UNHCR Guidelines and the Finnish/Swiss report, which appears to rely heavily on the UNHCR’s conclusions in this respect, M.Y.H. and Others, §§ 30 and 35 respectively). However, the difficulties faced by some at the KRI checkpoints do not seem to be relevant for Christians. This has been noted by, among others, the UNHCR. Rather, members of the Christian group are given preferential treatment as compared to others wishing to enter the Kurdistan Region. As stated by a representative of an international organisation and the head of Asaysih, the KRI general security authority, to investigators of the Danish/UK fact-finding mission, this is because Christians are at particular risk of terrorist attacks in southern and central Iraq and as the Christians are not considered to pose any terrorist threat themselves (at 4.34 and 8.19 of the report, M.Y.H. and Others, § 36).42. Moreover, while Christians may be able to enter the three northern governorates without providing any documentation at all (see Danish/UK report, at 4.34), in any event there does not seem to be any difficulty to obtain identity documents in case old ones have been lost. As concluded by the UK Border Agency (M.Y.H. and Others, § 31) and the UK Upper Tribunal in the recent country guidance case of HM and others (M.Y.H. and Others, § 34), it is possible for an individual to obtain identity documents from a central register in Baghdad, which retains identity records on microfiche, whether he or she is applying from abroad or within Iraq. In regard to the need for a sponsor resident in the Kurdistan Region, the Upper Tribunal further concluded, in the case mentioned above, that no-one was required to have a sponsor, whether for their entry into or for their continued residence in the KRI. It appears that the UNHCR is of the same opinion as regards entry, although its statement in the Guidelines directly concerns only the requirements of a tourist (M.Y.H. and Others, § 30). The Finnish/Swiss report states that Christians may be able to nominate senior clerics as sponsors (M.Y.H. and Others, § 35); thus, they do not have to have a personal acquaintance to vouch for them.43. Internal relocation inevitably involves certain hardship. Various sources have attested that people who relocate to the Kurdistan Region may face difficulties, for instance, in finding proper jobs and housing there, not the least if they do not speak Kurdish. Nevertheless, the evidence before the Court suggests that there are jobs available and that settlers have access to health care as well as financial and other support from the UNHCR and local authorities. In any event, there is no indication that the general living conditions in the KRI for a Christian settler would be unreasonable or in any way amount to treatment prohibited by Article 3. Nor is there a real risk of his or her ending up in the other parts of Iraq.44. In conclusion, therefore, the Court considers that relocation to the Kurdistan Region is a viable alternative for a Christian fearing persecution or ill-treatment in other parts of Iraq. The reliance by a Contracting State on such an alternative would thus not, in general, give rise to an issue under Article 3.(e) The particular circumstances of the applicant45. It remains for the Court to determine whether, despite what has been stated above, the personal circumstances of the applicant would make it unreasonable for him to settle in the Kurdistan Region. In this respect, the Court first notes that the applicant’s account was examined by the Migration Board and the Migration Court, which both gave extensive reasons for their decisions that he was not in need of protection in Sweden. The applicant was able to present the arguments he wished with the assistance of legal counsel and language interpretation.46. As regards the suffering which the applicant and his family experienced in Iraq, the Court notes, without underestimating their serious nature, that they all occurred in Baghdad. It has not been shown that he would be at risk in the Kurdistan Region, and the applicant’s misgivings as to the possibility for him to settle there are not supported by the information on the KRI available to the Court.47. The Court notes that the applicant’s wife and daughter have been granted permanent residence permits in Sweden and that the wife was expected to give birth to another child in October 2012. The applicant’s deportation would inevitably separate the applicant from his wife and children, at least temporarily, but the applicant may apply for a residence permit based on family ties upon his return to Iraq. It should further be borne in mind that the applicant has not complained, at any stage of the proceedings in the present case, of a violation of his right to respect for his family life. Should a future request for a residence permit based on family ties be rejected by the Swedish authorities, he is free to submit a new application to the Court under Article 8 of the Convention, supplying the Court with all the information necessary for it to examine whether his right under that provision has been respected.(f) Conclusion48. Having regard to the above, the Court concludes that, although the applicant, as Christian, belongs to a vulnerable minority and irrespective of whether he can be said to face, as a member of that group, a real risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 of the Convention in the southern and central parts of Iraq, he may reasonably relocate to the Kurdistan Region, where he will not face such a risk. Neither the general situation in that region, including that of the Christian minority, nor any of the applicant’s personal circumstances indicate the existence of said risk.Consequently, his deportation to Iraq would not involve a violation of Article 3.II. RULE 39 OF THE RULES OF COURT49. The Court recalls that, in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, the present judgment will not become final until (a) the parties declare that they will not request that the case be referred to the Grand Chamber; or (b) three months after the date of the judgment, if reference of the case to the Grand Chamber has not been requested; or (c) the Panel of the Grand Chamber rejects any request to refer under Article 43 of the Convention.50. It considers that the indication made to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court (see § 4 above) must continue in force until the present judgment becomes final or until the Court takes a further decision in this connection (see operative part).FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Declares unanimously the application admissible;2. Holds by five votes to two that the implementation of the deportation order against the applicant would not give rise to a violation of Article 3 of the Convention;3. Decides unanimously to continue to indicate to the Government under Rule 39 of the Rules of Court that it is desirable in the interests of the proper conduct of the proceedings not to deport the applicant until such time as the present judgment becomes final or until further order.Done in English, and notified in writing on 27 June 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Claudia Westerdiek Mark Villiger Registrar PresidentIn accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the separate opinion of Judge Power-Forde joined by Judge Zupančič is annexed to this judgment.M.V.C.W.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v. Sweden, I voted against the majority in finding that Article 3 would not be breached in the event that the deportation order made in respect of this applicant were to be executed. My dissent was based on the failure of the majority to test whether the requisite guarantees required by the Court’s case law prior to a deportation based on internal flight options, were established in this case.However, apart from that question of principle in relation to internal flight options, I have serious doubts as to whether the applicant’s deportation would, in any event, be in compliance with Article 3 of the Convention.The applicant is a 45-year-old man from Baghdad who was and is an active member of the Syrian Orthodox church. He lived with his wife and two children in Baghdad. He has had a particularly severe history of suffering during the war in Iraq because of his religious belief. In February 2007 his wife received threatening letters warning her to leave her job teaching Arabic at an Iraqi university. His family was required to go into hiding. His son was abducted and strangled and his remains were dumped on a street. The police authorities were informed but little was done. A similar threat was then made on his daughter’s life. Eventually, the applicant and his family fled to Syria in September 2007 and, thereafter, the applicant went to Sweden to seek asylum.In the meantime, and having regard to the deteriorating situation in Syria, the applicant’s wife returned to Baghdad in 2010 in search of work. She was kidnapped, attacked and raped by a group of men. She finally came to Sweden with her daughter where both of them were granted asylum.Clearly, the applicant and his wife and daughter were separated for some time, not least, as a consequence of the legacy of war in their home country. However, it is equally clear that the applicant has since reunited with his wife and daughter and that they have been living together for some time. A third child has been born of their marriage in October 2012.Having regard to what the applicant has already endured—the loss of his home, the death of his son, the flight of his family, the assaults upon his wife, the fracturing of their relationship and the ultimate reunification of his family—the suffering that would be imposed upon him by separating him, once again, from his family and his newborn child and by forcing him to return to Iraq—would, to my mind, cross the threshold of suffering required by Article 3.I appreciate that the applicant’s claim is not brought under Article 8 of the Convention. I also recognise that the threat under Article 3 must be assessed in terms of future risk. However, when assessing future risk one has to have regard to the individual circumstances of each case and to the level of suffering to which an individual has already been exposed. Such previous experience may be sufficient to break a person’s moral or psychological resistance in the event that he or she is further exposed to additional suffering.To my mind, given what this applicant has already endured it would be inhuman and degrading to separate him once again from his immediate family, which he has finally managed to hold together despite the trauma of war. The additional suffering that this would entail would be sufficient, to my mind, to break his moral and psychological resistance and would extend beyond the level permitted by Article 3 of the Convention.The expulsion of a person on the basis that internal flight relocation is available may, in altogether different circumstances, be compatible with Article 3. However, having regard to the circumstances of this applicant’s case, his expulsion to Iraq would not, in my view. be compatible with that Article of the Convention.It is formalistic in the extreme to expect that the applicant should be forced to leave his wife and children, once again, purely for the purposes of travelling to the Kurdish region so that, from there, he may contact a Swedish Embassy and apply for family reunification.Therefore, both for the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in M.Y.H. and Others v Sweden and on the merits of this case, I consider that the applicant’s removal to Iraq would violate Article 3.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE POWER-FORDE JOINED BY JUDGE ZUPANČIČFor the reasons set out in my dissenting opinion in the case of M.Y.H. and Others v.

       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 973, 'The Law': 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF ARTICLES 3 AND 13 OF THE CONVENTION21. The applicant complained, under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention, of having contracted TB in prison, of insufficient medical care for his various diseases throughout the entire period of his detention, and of having been deprived of effective remedies in this respect. He further challenged the conditions of his detention in Rustavi nos. 1 and 6 Prisons in the periods between 18 July 2008 and 4 March 2010 and 23 July 2010 up to the present as inadequate. Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention read as follows:Article 3“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 13“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”A. Admissibility1. The parties’ arguments22. The Government argued that the complaint about poor conditions of detention was unsubstantiated. In support, they submitted two letters from the Governors of the prison facilities involved, describing in detail the conditions of the applicant’s detention. According to these letters, the applicant was being kept in satisfactory conditions; the sanitary and hygienic norms were met; he was allowed to take a shower at least once a week and had been provided with all basic items of hygiene. In Rustavi no. 1 Prison, an open-type prison, the applicant was allowed six hours’ outdoor exercise on a daily basis, whilst in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a closed institution, he had been allowed at least a one-hour walk per day. On the basis of the relevant service provider contracts, the Government further argued that the food available to the applicant in both establishments was prepared in accordance with the legally approved norms, and that the applicant was regularly provided with the basic items of hygiene. In sum, the conditions of the applicant’s detention were compatible with Article 3.23. As regards the applicant’s alleged infection with TB and the inadequacy of the medical treatment provided to him in prison, the Government submitted that these complaints were premature, as the applicant had neither filed, under the relevant administrative rules, complaints of a lack of medical care in prison, nor sought monetary compensation for non-pecuniary damage under the relevant provisions of the General Administrative Code and the Civil Code. In support of the latter argument they submitted a case where the domestic authorities had awarded compensation for the death in detention of the plaintiff’s husband, which had been caused by a lack of appropriate medical treatment. This decision was adopted by the domestic court in the framework of the friendly settlement proceedings in the case of Gamrekelashvili v. Georgia ((dec.) no. 6439/10, 6 September 2011).24. In reply, the applicant reiterated his general allegations about poor conditions of sanitation and hygiene, lack of outdoor exercise, and the diet, without providing any concrete details.25. As regards the medical complaint, the applicant claimed that the administrative-law remedy proposed by the Government was completely ineffective, as it involved extremely time-consuming and inefficient court proceedings. He did not comment on the adequacy of the compensatory remedies suggested by the Government.2. The Court’s assessment(a) Conditions of detention26. The Court notes that information about conditions of detention falls within the knowledge of the domestic authorities. Accordingly, applicants might experience certain difficulties in procuring evidence to substantiate a complaint in that connection. Still, in such cases applicants may well be expected to submit at least a detailed account of the facts complained of and provide – to the greatest possible extent – some evidence in support of their complaints (see Visloguzov v. Ukraine, no. 32362/02, § 45, 20 May 2010, and Ukhan v. Ukraine, no. 30628/02, § 65, 18 December 2008).27. Turning to the circumstances of the present case, the Court finds that the applicant’s allegations were formulated as vague and general statements (see paragraphs 12 and 24 above). While it is aware of the fact that poor conditions of detention constituted a general structural problem in the penal sector in Georgia at the material time (see, amongst others, Janiashvili v. Georgia, no. 35887/05, § 70, 27 November 2012) the Court cannot ignore the simple fact that the applicant failed to provide a detailed account concerning the conditions in which he was held (see, for example, Visloguzov, cited above, §§ 48-49, and Ukhan, cited above, § 65). In view of the foregoing, the Court considers that this part of the application has not been properly substantiated by the applicant (see Shkurenko v. Russia (dec.) no. 15010/04, 10 September 2009). Therefore, it should be rejected as being manifestly ill-founded, pursuant to Article 35 §§ 3 and 4 of the Convention.(b) Infection with TB28. As to the alleged infection with TB in prison, the applicant in the current case has never attempted to bring a civil claim for damages for his alleged infection. The Court notes, however, that it has previously examined a similar situation and found that a civil claim for damages under Article 207 of the General Administrative Code and Article 413 of the Civil Code was the most effective remedy to be used (see Goloshvili v. Georgia, no. 45566/08, §§ 24-25 and 32-33, 23 October 2012; see also Jeladze, cited above, § 35). The Court sees no reason to depart from its previous conclusion and considers that this aspect of the complaint under Article 3 of the Convention must be rejected under Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention for non-exhaustion of domestic remedies.(c) Medical treatment29. As to the alleged absence of adequate medical care in prison, the Court reiterates that prior to 1 October 2010, the Georgian law and practice did not provide for an effective legal remedy allowing a claimant to obtain injunctive relief in a situation concerning lack of medical care in prison. Consequently, it was sufficient for an ill detainee, who wished to complain to the Court of a lack of adequate medical care, to have alerted the relevant domestic authorities about his or her state of health (see Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 51-54 and 57; Makharadze and Sikharulidze, cited above, §§ 53‑55; Goloshvili, cited above, §§ 34-35, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 31-33). In view of the relevant circumstances of the case, the Court considers that the prison authorities were made sufficiently aware of the applicant’s medical situation and had an opportunity to offer redress (see paragraphs 11-14 above). Consequently, having regard to the above case‑law on the subject matter, the Court dismisses the Government’s objection of non-exhaustion.30. The Court notes that the applicant’s complaint under Article 3 of the Convention concerning the lack of adequate medical treatment in prison is not manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a) of the Convention. It further notes that it is not inadmissible on any other grounds. It must therefore be declared admissible.B. Merits1. Submissions by the parties31. The Government firstly submitted that the positive obligations under Article 3 of the Convention did not encompass an obligation on States to conduct compulsory screening for the presence of tuberculosis. They claimed in this connection that the first time the applicant had voiced his grievances concerning possible infection with TB was in January 2010, and by February 2010 he had been provided with all the required medical examinations and treatment. Hence, the examination for TB was not belated.32. With respect to the anti-tuberculosis treatment itself, the Government argued, relying on the relevant medical reports, that the applicant had been provided with the necessary medical assistance without interruption since his diagnosis was revealed. At the initial stage he had been administered with comprehensive in-patient treatment in the prison hospital and Ksani prison, which had included the relevant tests, repeated consultations with medical specialists, the necessary medication, and so on. Subsequently, the applicant had been transferred to Rustavi no. 1 Prison. The Government explained that this had become possible only after a significant improvement in the applicant’s medical condition. They dismissed the applicant’s allegation according to which Rustavi no. 1 Prison was not capable of providing him with adequate medical care. The Government submitted in this connection a letter dated 18 August 2010 from the Ministry of Prisons, according to which the DOTS programme, which allows for the provision of the relevant anti-tuberculosis drugs to infected prisoners, has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 prison since 10 June 2010.33. The Government also claimed with respect to his other diseases that the applicant had been provided with the requisite medical treatment from the very beginning of his detention. In support, they submitted, as regards the treatment allegedly available in Rustavi no. 6 Prison, a letter of the prison Governor dated 13 August 2009 (see paragraph 13 above) and an unnamed and undated one-page extract from a medical file, according to which Finlepsin had been provided to the applicant for his epilepsy. As regards the post-February 2010 period, the Government submitted a copy of the applicant’s full medical file. The relevant excerpts showed, according to the Government, that the applicant had been provided with adequate drug‑based treatment for his epilepsy, chronic bronchitis and other minor ailments. The applicant’s diagnosis of circulatory dystonia had not been confirmed.34. In reply, the applicant reiterated his complaint that the treatment dispensed to him in prison had been inadequate. Notably, he noted that firstly his medical examination, despite repeated medical complaints, had been conducted with substantial delay, which had had a detrimental effect on his medical condition; moreover, his eight-month anti-TB treatment course in Ksani no. 8 Prison had suddenly been interrupted by his unjustified transfer on 23 July 2010 to Rustavi no. 1 Prison, which had not been properly equipped to treat him. Lastly, the applicant vaguely claimed that he had not been treated for the rest of his diseases.2. The Court’s assessment(a) General principles35. The relevant general principles concerning the adequacy of medical treatment in prisons have been summarised by the Court in the cases of Goginashvili, cited above, §§ 69-70, Jeladze, cited above, §§ 41-42, and Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 39-40.(b) Application of the principles to the present case36. The Court considers that the applicant’s current complaint could be divided into two periods, before and after the applicant’s diagnosis with TB in February 2010.(i) Before February 201037. The Court notes that the applicant was arrested on 4 October 2007 and put immediately in pre-trial detention. In November 2008 he was diagnosed with, inter alia, chronic bronchitis.38. At this point, the Court would first address the Government’s argument concerning the timing of the applicant’s TB test (see paragraph 31 above). The gravity of the problem of tuberculosis in the Georgian prisons, as well as the role of the above-mentioned screening in minimising the spread of this disease, was already acknowledged by the Court in its case‑law on the matter (see Ghavtadze v. Georgia, no. 23204/07, §§ 103‑105, 3 March 2009; see also, Poghosyan, cited above, § 69, and, mutatis mutandis, Jeladze, cited above, § 44). In the present case the applicant did not have a screening test for tuberculosis during the initial two and a half years of his detention. Even after his diagnosis with chronic bronchitis, his requests for medical assistance were left unnoticed (see paragraphs 11-14 above). The Court finds this negligence on the part of the relevant prison authorities to be incompatible with the general obligation to prevent the transmission of tuberculosis and other contagious diseases in prisons (see Jeladze, cited above, § 44, with further references therein).39. On a more general note, the Court observes that the Government failed to submit any medical evidence concerning the applicant’s medical condition during the initial period of his detention, or the treatment administered to him during that time (see, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, § 70, cited above). Neither the letter of the prison Governor nor the undated one-page extract from a medical file (see paragraphs 13 and 33 above) can serve as a sufficient proof in this case (see Irakli Mindadze, cited above, §§ 42-45).40. That being so, the Government, in the Court’s opinion, have failed in accounting for the detained applicant’s state of health and thus in discharging their part of the burden of proof (see, Jeladze, cited above, § 45 and, Irakli Mindadze, cited above, § 47; see also, a contrario, Goginashvili, cited above, § 72, and Janiashvili, cited above, § 75). The Court, hence, considers that until February 2010 the applicant was left without appropriate medical care in violation of Article 3 of the Convention.(ii) After February 201041. Turning now to the post-diagnosis period, the Court notes that in early February 2010 the applicant was diagnosed with smear-positive focal pulmonary TB at the stage of infiltration. He was immediately placed on the DOTS programme and started receiving all the required first-line anti‑tuberculosis agents on the premises of Ksani no. 8 Prison. On 21 May 2010 the applicant underwent a bacteriological sputum test which was smear-negative. Subsequently, on 23 July 2010, he was transferred to the medical unit of Rustavi no. 1 Prison, where he began the second phase of his anti-TB treatment.42. The Court notes that the applicant’s transfer to a normal prison took place only after the first-phase anti-tuberculosis treatment had yielded positive results (see paragraphs 18 and 32 above). It further observes, on the basis of the relevant medical evidence, that the applicant’s eight-month treatment was not interrupted but rather continued at Rustavi no. 1 Prison (see paragraph 32 above). Hence, the only issue pending before the Court is to assess whether Rustavi no. 1 Prison was adequately equipped to provide the applicant with the second-phase anti-TB treatment.43. The Court would make the following observations in this connection: firstly, the DOTS programme has been administered in Rustavi no. 1 Prison since 10 June 2010, whilst the applicant was transferred to that prison on 23 July 2010; secondly, according to the available medical evidence, the applicant has continued to receive second-phase anti-TB drugs in line with the DOTS standards; thirdly, the available medical evidence reveals that the applicant has been under permanent medical supervision since his transfer to Rustavi no.1 Prison, with periodic medical check-ups conducted in the prison hospital. Lastly, the latest bacteriological sputum tests performed on the applicant confirmed the smear-negative results.44. Against this background the Court finds the applicant’s argument concerning the inadequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment administered to him in Rustavi no. 1 Prison unsubstantiated. Whilst acknowledging that there may be advantages to anti-tuberculosis treatment provided on an in‑patient basis, the Court nevertheless concludes, having duly examined the applicant’s medical file, that there are not sufficient grounds for questioning the adequacy of the anti-tuberculosis treatment provided to the applicant following his diagnosis of February 2010.45. As regards the applicant’s other diseases, the Government submitted his full medical file, from which it appears that he has been placed under permanent medical supervision as far as the period after February 2010 concerns; the applicant’s epilepsy has been under control, as no epileptic seizures have been recorded and he has been provided with the required drug-based treatment for this and other of his medical conditions. The applicant failed to point to any specific inadequacies in this area.46. In view of the above, the Court finds no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to be applicant following his diagnosis of tuberculosis in February 2010.47. In the light of the conclusions reached above (see paragraphs 40 and 46 above), the Court does not consider that it is also necessary to consider this complaint under Article 13 of the Convention.II. OTHER ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE CONVENTION48. The applicant alleged, relying on Article 3 of the Convention, that he had been beaten by unidentified prison officers on an unspecified date in Gldani no. 8 prison. Under Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, he also challenged the outcome of the criminal proceedings conducted against him. He maintained, inter alia, that the domestic courts had improperly assessed the circumstances of his case and that, instead of endorsing the incriminating evidence, the courts should have subscribed to his arguments in defence. Invoking Article 13 of the Convention, in conjunction with the above-mentioned provision, the applicant also complained that an application to the Supreme Court was not an effective judicial remedy, as that court had rejected his cassation appeal as inadmissible.49. In the light of all the material in its possession, and in so far as the matters complained of are within its competence, the Court finds that they do not disclose any appearance of a violation of the rights and freedoms set out in the Convention or its Protocols. It follows that this part of the application is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.III. APPLICATION OF ARTICLE 41 OF THE CONVENTION50. Article 41 of the Convention provides:“If the Court finds that there has been a violation of the Convention or the Protocols thereto, and if the internal law of the High Contracting Party concerned allows only partial reparation to be made, the Court shall, if necessary, afford just satisfaction to the injured party.”A. Damage51. The applicant claimed 950 euros (EUR) in respect of expenses his family had incurred in supporting him in prison and EUR 23 for medicines he had purchased. In addition, he claimed EUR 4,250 in compensation for the expenses his family would have to incur to support him in prison for the remaining seventeen years of his imprisonment. In respect of non-pecuniary damage, the applicant claimed EUR 45,000.52. The Government contested these claims, stating that they were groundless.53. The Court rejects as unsubstantiated the costs borne for the medicines. As regards the remainder of the claim for pecuniary damage, the Court does not discern any causal link between the violation found and the pecuniary damage alleged in connection with the applicant’s past and future living expenses in prison; it therefore rejects that claim. However, having regard to its conclusions under Article 3 of the Convention, and making its own assessment on an equitable basis, the Court awards the applicant EUR 4,500 for non-pecuniary damage.B. Costs and expenses54. The applicant claimed, on the basis of two bank statements, EUR 166 in respect of his representation before the domestic court. He also claimed a total of EUR 66 for postal expenses, without submitting any relevant bills in support.55. The Government argued that this claim was unsubstantiated.56. In the light of its well-established case-law on the matter (see, for instance, Ghavtadze, cited above, §§ 118 and 120 and Saghinadze and Others v. Georgia, no. 18768/05, § 164, 27 May 2010), and having due regard to the insufficient documentary evidence in its possession, the Court rejects this claim.C. Default interest57. The Court considers it appropriate that the default interest rate should be based on the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank, to which should be added three percentage points.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT UNANIMOUSLY1. Declares the complaints under Articles 3 and 13 of the Convention concerning the alleged absence of adequate medical treatment for the applicant in prison and the lack of effective remedies in this regard admissible and the remainder of the application inadmissible;2. Holds that there has been a violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the inadequate medical treatment provided to the applicant in prison until February 2010;3. Holds that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention on account of the medical treatment provided to the applicant after February 2010;4. Holds that it is not necessary to consider the complaint under Article 13 of the Convention;5. Holds(a) that the respondent State is to pay the applicant, within three months of the date on which the judgment becomes final in accordance with Article 44 § 2 of the Convention, EUR 4,500 (four thousand five hundred euros) in respect of non-pecuniary damage, plus any tax that may be chargeable, to be converted into the currency of the respondent State at the rate applicable on the date of settlement:(b) that from the expiry of the above-mentioned three months until settlement simple interest shall be payable on the above amount at a rate equal to the marginal lending rate of the European Central Bank during the default period plus three percentage points;6. Dismisses the remainder of the applicant’s claim for just satisfaction.Done in English, and notified in writing on 23 April 2013, pursuant to Rule 77 §§ 2 and 3 of the Rules of Court.Santiago Quesada Josep Casadevall Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2013-04-23 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-118646', 'appno': '65391/09', 'doctypebranch': 'CHAMBER', 'respondent': 'GEO', 'extractedappno': '65391/09;47729/08;35254/07;1871/08;6439/10;32362/02;30628/02;35887/05;15010/04;45566/08;23204/07;18768/05', 'conclusion': 'Violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect);No violation of Article 3 - Prohibition of torture (Article 3 - Degrading treatment;Inhuman treatment) (Substantive aspect)', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '350;90;193', 'doc_id': '53d0f9b1-3e7d-44ce-bbbf-2d978647eac5'}, page_content='Jeladze v.

The applicant complains that the prosecution should have been declared inadmissible on grounds that the applicant\\'s rights under Article 3 had been violated in that the police officers had forced the applicant to lower his pants and underpants in a public place. He further complains under Article 3 of the Convention that he would have to serve his sentence in the Koraalspecht prison on the isle of Curaçao, where the conditions of detention, according to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in its Report CPT/Inf (96)1, constitute inhuman and degrading treatment.Article 3 of the Convention reads as follows:\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"The Court observes that the applicant raised these two complaints under Article 3 of the Convention for the first time in his appeal in cassation to the Supreme Court, which appeal is limited to points of law and procedural conformity. It further observes that the Procurator-General to the Supreme Court advised the Supreme Court to reject both complaints on the ground that in cassation proceedings no facts or circumstances can be raised which have not been argued before the trial courts. The Court finally observes that the Supreme Court rejected these complaints in its judgment of 11 November 1997, holding that they did not prompt a determination of legal issues in the interest of legal unity and legal development and that, after an ex officio examination, the Supreme Court found no grounds on the basis of which the judgment of the Joint Court of Appeal should be quashed.The Court considers that the mere fact that all remedies have been tried does not of itself constitute compliance with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies. It is also required that applicants, either in form or in substance, have submitted to the competent authorities the complaint they are bringing before the Court (cf. Eur. Court HR, Akdivar and Others v. Turkey judgment of 16 September 1996, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-IV No. 15, p. 1210, § 66).It is true that the applicant did raise these complaints before the Supreme Court. However, under domestic law, cassation proceedings are limited to points of law and procedural conformity and no complaints can be raised in such proceedings which concern facts or circumstances which have not been raised or determined by a trial court. Moreover, as regards the Report CPT/Inf (96)1 of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment relied upon by the applicant, the Court notes that this Report was published on 18 January 1996, i.e. more than three months before the Joint Court of Appeal handed down its judgment in the present case. It has not been argued nor does it appear that the defence had no knowledge or could not reasonably have had knowledge of this Report at the relevant time.The Court is therefore of the opinion that the applicant, by having failed to raise these complaints under Article 3 of the Convention before the trial court competent to determine these factual issues, i.e. in the present case the Joint Court of Appeal, has not complied with the requirement of exhaustion of domestic remedies.It follows that these complaints must be rejected under Article 35 para. 3 of the Convention.2. The applicant further complains under Article 6 of the Convention that the Joint Court of Appeal had unjustly rejected his argument that the evidence against him had been fabricated and that the finding of the cocaine had been faked.Article 6 of the Convention, insofar as relevant, reads:\"In the determination of ... any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair ... hearing ... by a ... tribunal ....”The Court considers that it is not competent to examine errors of fact or law committed by national courts, except where it considers that such errors might have involved a possible violation of the rights and freedoms set forth in the Convention (cf. Eur. Court HR, Schenk v. Switzerland judgment of 12 July 1988, Series A no. 140, p. 29, § 45; and No. 25062/94, Dec. 18.10.95, D.R. 83, p. 77).The Court notes that the applicant has been convicted following adversarial proceedings. It has not been argued nor does it appear that the applicant has not been able to state his case or has not been able to state it sufficiently, to challenge the evidence against him or to submit whatever he found relevant for the outcome of his case.In these circumstances, the Court finds no indication that the proceedings at issue fell short of the requirements of Article 6 of the Convention.It follows that this complaint must be rejected as manifestly ill-founded within the meaning of Article 35 para. 3 of the Convention.Accordingly, the CourtDECLARES THE APPLICATION INADMISSIBLE.Michael O\\'Boyle Elisabeth PalmRegistrar President', 'date': Timestamp('1999-01-19 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-4906', 'appno': '39390/98', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITYCOM', 'respondent': 'NLD', 'extractedappno': '39390/98;25062/94', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible', 'importance': 4, 'kpthesaurus': '14;128;350', 'doc_id': '57a010e3-cc2e-4ef5-a522-5236ca4360a0'}, page_content='sentence in the Koraalspecht prison on the isle of Curaçao, where the conditions of detention, according to the findings of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in its Report CPT/Inf (96)1, constitute inhuman and degrading treatment.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 9487, 'The Law': '...II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 OF THE CONVENTION58. The applicant complained that the domestic courts had principally and essentially based his conviction for participation in a terrorist organisation on evidence that was vitiated and obtained in conditions that were incompatible with the requirements of the Convention. Alleging a violation of his right to a fair trial, he relied on Article 6 of the Convention, of which paragraphs 1 and 3 (d) read as follows:“1. In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law. ...”“3. Everyone charged with a criminal offence has the following minimum rights: ...(d) to examine or have examined witnesses against him and to obtain the attendance and examination of witnesses on his behalf under the same conditions as witnesses against him; ...”...Secondly, he complained that, in finding that he had participated in a leading capacity in the activities of the Moroccan Islamic Fighting Group, the Brussels Court of Appeal, in breach of section 13 of the Belgian Mutual Legal Assistance Act of 9 December 2004, had based its findings decisively on statements that had been obtained in proceedings to which he was not a party, which had taken place in France and Morocco. ... Those statements, he claimed, had been made as a result of treatment in breach of Article 3 of the Convention....A. The parties’ submissions1. The Government...63. Thirdly, the Government asked the Court to dismiss the applicant’s argument that the Belgian courts had invoked statements that had been taken in France and Morocco in conditions that breached Article 3 of the Convention.The Government did not dispute the fact that, according to the Court’s case-law, the use by a court of evidence thus obtained would entail a violation of Article 6 § 1, even if the admission of such evidence was not decisive in securing a conviction. In addition, referring in this connection to the judgment of the United Kingdom House of Lords in the case of A. and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (no. 2) and to Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, of 10 December 1984, they took the view that this principle should also apply where the breach of Article 3 had not been committed by the respondent State.64. Relying on that same judgment and provision, and also on the El Motassadeq judgment of 14 June 2005 of the Hanseatic Court of Appeal of Hamburg and on the Court’s case-law, the Government nevertheless argued that the exclusionary rule did not apply unless it was clear that the statements in question had been obtained by torture. In their opinion, it was incumbent upon the applicant first to adduce evidence in support of his allegation. In that connection, a mere suspicion was insufficient: the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” applied, bearing in mind that such proof might “follow from the coexistence of sufficiently strong, clear and concordant inferences or of similar unrebutted presumptions of fact”; the applicant must at least be able to allege “on arguable grounds” that such evidence had been obtained as a result of torture.The Government emphasised that the argument whereby an item of evidence had to be excluded if there was a “real risk” that it had been obtained by torture could not be upheld, in the light of the wording of Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. They further observed that the “test of real risk” was in fact the test applied by the Court when it examined allegations of a potential violation of Article 3 in the event of the extradition or expulsion of an individual to a State where he might be subjected to treatment or punishment in breach of that Article. In cases such as the present, it was not a matter of determining whether there was a risk of such treatment, but whether such treatment had actually been inflicted on those individuals whose testimony was at issue.65. In the Government’s submission, even supposing that the applicant’s allegations concerning the interviews carried out in France were “arguable”, within the meaning of the Court’s case-law, the Court of Appeal had found, after a detailed examination of the available documents, that it not been established that the French authorities had breached Article 3. The court had begun by finding, in the light of the documents from the French proceedings, that all the procedural safeguards and the rights of the persons interviewed had been respected (the right to be immediately informed of the “complaint” and of one’s rights in police custody, the right to request an examination by a doctor, the right to have a lawyer, etc.). It had then found that the conditions in which the impugned interviews had taken place were acceptable and that the allegations of violence, intimidation and torture or inhuman and degrading treatment on the part of the police officers at the time of arrest and questioning, judging from the statements in question and from the file, lacked credibility. It had moreover taken the view that it did not suffice for the applicant to refer to general considerations contained in reports by NGOs on the functioning of the French judicial system in order to show that there had been a breach of Article 3 of the Convention. The Government further pointed out that the French witnesses had not brought proceedings before the Court for a violation of that provision.As regards the testimony taken in Morocco, the Government pointed out that the Court of Appeal had found that the applicant had not adduced the slightest evidence of a violation of Article 3. They draw attention to the following findings: “... the fact of citing in general terms various reports of human rights organisations – admittedly respectable ones – does not adduce any concrete evidence that would be capable of giving rise in the present case to the above-mentioned reasonable doubt as to the violence, torture or inhuman or degrading treatment that was allegedly inflicted on the individuals interviewed in Morocco ...”; and “... the contradictions allegedly contained in those statements, according to defence counsel’s argument, are not capable of justifying the claim that the individuals who were interviewed and/or tried in Morocco were subjected to any inhuman and degrading treatment or torture”.66. The Government were of the view that the authorities could not be criticised for failing to carry out an investigation into allegations that were so poorly substantiated.They added that, before the Court, as before the domestic courts, the applicant had failed to adduce any concrete evidence to show that the impugned statements had been taken using torture and inhuman or degrading treatment.2. The applicant...69. As regards the application in the present case of the rule that evidence obtained by means contrary to Article 3 must be excluded, the applicant was of the view that it also applied to evidence obtained by such means in a foreign country, if the object and purpose of the Convention were not to be meaningless. He had reached this conclusion in particular from the wording of Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, from the case-law of the Committee against Torture and from the above-cited A. and others judgment of the House of Lords.70. The applicant further argued that the Government had been wrong to conclude from the above-cited Article 15 and the A. and others judgment that the burden of proof lay fully with him to show that the impugned statements had been obtained by a means contrary to Article 3.He observed that the standard adopted by the House of Lords in A. and others consisted in ascertaining whether it was “established, by means of such diligent enquiries into the sources that it [was] practicable to carry out and on a balance of probabilities, that the information [had been] obtained under torture”, and that the highest British court seemed to have concluded that the reports of humanitarian organisations did not suffice to show the “established nature” of torture sustained by a complainant. In his view, having regard to the purpose of the Convention and the need for effective protection of fundamental rights, the burden of proof that lay with a defendant should not, however, be “inaccessible”: it should be considered sufficient for him or her to show the existence of a “real risk” that the evidence had been obtained by torture, and to produce for that purpose the reports of respectable NGOs indicating that, in the country in question, torture was practised systematically. To require a defendant to provide more concrete information when he or she had no means of investigating in a foreign country would be asking the impossible. In other words, the defendant should merely be required to show the “likelihood” of what he or she alleged. The applicant claimed that, for his part, he had made such a demonstration.71. As regards the statements obtained in Morocco, the applicant claimed that it was not in dispute that this country had been severely criticised by both governmental and non-governmental organisations for torture and ill-treatment inflicted systematically on persons charged with acts of terrorism after the Casablanca bombings in May 2003. The individuals who had given the statements incriminating the applicant had precisely been prosecuted in that context and during that period.He then pointed out that, before the Belgian courts, he had relied on the following evidence to show the existence of torture:- Reports condemning a systematic practice of ill-treatment of suspects in the months following the Casablanca bombings, in particular the Human Rights Watch report of 2005 (entitled “Morocco’s Truth Commission: Honoring Past Victims during an Uncertain Present”), which noted that, according to various human rights organisations, over 2,000 suspected Islamists had been detained, many in secret detention, for days or even weeks, and had been subjected by the police to various forms of ill-treatment, and in some cases torture, in order to extract confessions.- The fact that the individuals in question had complained of acts of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment – in particular a certain N., who had apparently been arrested in Mauritania and had been held in secret detention for several months – and that the Moroccan authorities had not carried out any investigation in response to those allegations.- The fact that they had been held in police custody for twelve days, under the Terrorism Act of 28 May 2003, applied retroactively.- The fact that the Moroccan proceedings had taken place in a hurried manner, without the use of conventional methods of investigation....73. In the applicant’s submission, in view of the likelihood of his allegations relating to the statements taken in Morocco and France, Article 6 of the Convention obliged the Belgian courts either to carry out investigations into those allegations – the principle of the prohibition of torture triggering an obligation to investigate – or to exclude the evidence in question.B. Observations of third-party interveners1. The United Kingdom Government74. Referring to the Court’s case-law, the United Kingdom Government invited the Court to confirm the existence, for the purposes of Article 6 of the Convention, of an “exclusionary rule” on statements that had been obtained directly by torture, with the result that a violation of this Article should be found where the rule applied, irrespective of the overall fairness of the proceedings.However, referring in particular to the decision in Sharkunov and Mezentsev v. Russia (no. 75330/01, 2 July 2009), they further asked the Court to confirm that the alleged torture had to be established “beyond reasonable doubt”, and that, while general evidence of the human rights situation in the country from where the statement had been obtained might well be sufficient to trigger an inquiry by the domestic court into the provenance of the statement in issue, this would rarely be sufficient to establish “beyond reasonable doubt” that a particular statement had been obtained using torture: evidence of a direct causal link would in principle be necessary. They added that the standard of proof “beyond reasonable doubt” also corresponded to the requirement of Article 15 of the UN Convention against Torture, under which it had to be “established” that the statement in question had been made as a result of torture for the exclusionary rule to apply. That standard was moreover consistent with the approach taken by other courts and tribunals, in particular the United Kingdom House of Lords in A. and Others v. Secretary of State for the Home Department (no. 2).75. The United Kingdom Government further observed that it was clear from the Court’s case-law – in particular the judgments in Jalloh v. Germany ([GC], no. 54810/00, § 105, ECHR 2006‑IX) and Ashot Harutyunyan v. Armenia (no. 34334/04, 15 June 2010) – that the exclusionary rule did not apply where the domestic court was left with a doubt as to whether the statement had been obtained by torture or where it concluded that the ill-treatment did not reach the necessary threshold of severity to be classified as “torture”. It emphasised in this context that the above-mentioned Article 15 applied only in relation to torture and not to cases of other prohibited ill-treatment.In their view, in any event, the domestic courts retained in such cases some discretion as to the admissibility of and assessment of weight to be given to such a statement, to be exercised bearing in mind the special status of Article 3 and the fact that the use of a statement obtained as a result of a violation of one of the core rights guaranteed by the Convention raised serious issues as to the fairness of the proceedings. The fairness of the proceedings had then to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, considering the proceedings as a whole.2. NGOs European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights and REDRESS76. The third-party interveners pointed out that the “exclusionary rule”, which prohibited the admission of evidence obtained by torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, was enshrined in a number of international instruments: Article 12 of the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Article 10 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture, the Robben Island Guidelines for the Prohibition and Prevention of Torture, Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in Africa, adopted by the African Commission on Human and People’s Rights, and the rules of procedure of the ad hoc international criminal tribunals and of the International Criminal Court. They added that the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture had repeatedly emphasised the importance of the exclusionary rule, with the latter taking the view that it was an inherent part of the prohibition of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.77. In the submission of the third-party interveners, the exclusionary rule applies to evidence obtained not only by torture but also by other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. Whilst Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and Article 10 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture refer only to torture, Article 12 of the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment refers to other forms of prohibited ill-treatment; the position of the Human Rights Committee and the Committee against Torture is, moreover, consistent with the latter. In addition, the rule extends both to confessions by the person against whom evidence is being sought and to witness statements of third parties.Referring to the above-cited Jalloh and Ashot Harutyunyan judgments, they pointed out that it was clear from the Court’s case-law that the use of evidence obtained by torture automatically rendered the trial unfair. They further drew attention to the Court’s finding in Jalloh (§ 106) that where the evidence in question had been obtained by treatment contrary to Article 3 not amounting to torture, the impact on the fairness of the proceedings would depend on the circumstances of each individual case. They took the view, however, that the Court had left open the question whether the use of evidence obtained by other prohibited ill-treatment automatically rendered a trial unfair (ibid., § 107).78. The third-party interveners observed that the Committee against Torture had considered that the forum State was under an obligation to ensure that statements admitted in evidence in any proceedings had not been obtained by torture (they referred in this connection to the Committee’s decision in G.K. v. Switzerland). They indicated that, whilst there was little international jurisprudence on the burden and standard of proof, it was quite well established that, where a party to proceedings alleged that evidence had been obtained by torture, the forum State had a duty to investigate the circumstances in which it had been obtained; if that proved to be the case, the evidence had to be excluded. The jurisprudence was inconsistent, however, as to the extent to which an individual had to sustain his or her allegations. Referring to the decisions in Halimi-Nedzibi v. Austria, Encarnación Blanco Abad v. Spain, P.E. v. France and G.K. v. Switzerland, they observed that the Committee against Torture seemed to require the author to demonstrate that his or her allegations were “well founded” – adding, however, that some legal writers took the view, in the light of that jurisprudence, that it was sufficient for the alleged victim to submit “some evidence” of ill-treatment – and that this view was supported by domestic case-law. In the United States of America, the US District Court for Columbia had merely verified that the petitioning detainees had made “sufficient allegations” (Re Guantánamo Detainee Cases, 31 January 2005); in Canada, the Supreme Court of British Columbia had looked at the “persuasive nature of the allegations” (India v. Singh, 8 May 1996); and the Supreme Court of the Netherlands had examined whether the allegations were “plausible” (Hoge Raad, judgment no. 103.094, 1 October 1996).In the submission of the third-party interveners, most of the case-law indicated that the burden of proof could not rest with either the individual or the State alone (they referred, inter alia, to the Human Rights Committee’s decision in Saimijon and Bazarov v. Uzbekistan). They said that this had also been the approach of the House of Lords in A. and others, cited above.79. The third-party interveners further observed that under Article 15 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment it had to be “established” that the statement in question had been obtained by torture for the exclusionary rule to apply, and that similar wording was used in Article 10 of the Inter-American Convention to Prevent and Punish Torture and in Article 12 of the United Nations Declaration on the Protection of All Persons from Being Subjected to Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, as in the jurisprudence of the Committee against Torture and the Human Rights Committee. They added that in the case of A. and others, cited above, the House of Lords had considered the meaning of “established” in the context of the above-mentioned Article 15: the majority (four Law Lords out of seven) had interpreted it as requiring evidence to be excluded where it was “more likely than not” that torture had been used to obtain it; in the same vein, the Hamburg Court of Appeal, in its El Motassadeq judgment, cited above, had used certain testimonies despite the fact that serious doubts remained as to how they had been obtained.The interveners were, however, convinced by the opinion of the minority of Law Lords in the above-cited A. and others judgment, to the effect that the exclusionary rule had to apply where there was a “real risk” that evidence had been obtained by torture. In their view, the position of the majority of the Law Lords called into question the sharing of the burden of proof between the State and the defendant, by imposing on the latter too high a burden that in most cases would be impossible to meet. In their view, the fact that the evidence in question was intended to be used against someone accused of terrorism-related offences could not justify such a shift; they referred to the Court’s finding in Hulki Güneş v. Turkey (no. 28490/95, ECHR 2003-VII) that the need to combat terrorism could not justify a restriction on the very essence of the rights of the defence. This had also been the approach adopted by the Spanish Supreme Court in its judgment of 20 July 2006, reversing the conviction of Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed on the ground that, because of the disrespect for the fundamental rights of the Guantánamo detainees and for due process safeguards, any act carried out in the Guantánamo context had to be declared completely invalid and as such inexistent. They observed that, similarly, the 2009 report of the Eminent Jurists Panel on Terrorism, Counter-terrorism and Human Rights had expressed concern that, due to the international dimension of recent terrorism attacks, there had been cases where the prosecution had sought to rely on statements of the accused or witnesses obtained abroad under conditions that cast doubt on their reliability. They emphasised that the prevention of torture or other ill-treatment of detainees could only be effectively safeguarded if the judiciary responded urgently and effectively when any allegations concerning such ill-treatment were brought to their attention.C. The Court’s assessment...2. Merits(a) General principles81. The Court reiterates that its duty, pursuant to Article 19 of the Convention, is to ensure the observance of the engagements undertaken by the Contracting States to the Convention. In particular, it is not its function to deal with errors of fact or of law allegedly committed by a national court unless and in so far as they may have infringed rights and freedoms protected by the Convention. While Article 6 guarantees the right to a fair hearing, it does not lay down any rules on the admissibility of evidence as such, which is primarily a matter for regulation under national law (see, among other authorities, Schenk v. Switzerland, 12 July 1988, §§ 45-46, Series A no. 140; Teixeira de Castro v. Portugal, 9 June 1998, § 34, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998‑IV; Heglas v. the Czech Republic, no. 5935/02, § 84, 1 March 2007; and Gäfgen v. Germany [GC], no. 22978/05, § 162, ECHR 2010).82. It is not, therefore, the role of the Court to determine, as a matter of principle, whether particular types of evidence – for example, evidence obtained unlawfully in terms of domestic law – may be admissible. The question which must be answered is whether the proceedings as a whole, including the way in which the evidence was obtained, were fair. This involves an examination of the unlawfulness in question and, where the violation of another Convention right is concerned, the nature of the violation found (see, inter alia, Khan v. the United Kingdom, no. 35394/97, § 34, ECHR 2000‑V; P.G. and J.H. v. the United Kingdom, no. 44787/98, § 76, ECHR 2001-IX; Allan v. the United Kingdom, no. 48539/99, § 42, ECHR 2002‑IX; and Gäfgen, cited above, § 163).83. In determining whether the proceedings as a whole were fair, regard must also be had as to whether the rights of the defence have been respected. In particular, it must be examined whether the applicant was given an opportunity to challenge the authenticity of the evidence and to oppose its use. In addition, the quality of the evidence must be taken into consideration, as must the circumstances in which it was obtained and whether these circumstances cast doubt on its reliability or accuracy. While no problem of fairness necessarily arises where the evidence obtained was unsupported by other material, it may be noted that where the evidence is very strong and there is no risk of its being unreliable, the need for supporting evidence is correspondingly weaker (see, inter alia, Khan, cited above, §§ 35 and 37; Allan, cited above, § 43; Jalloh, cited above, § 96; and Gäfgen, cited above, § 164). In this connection, the Court further attaches weight to whether the evidence in question was or was not decisive for the outcome of the criminal proceedings (see Gäfgen, cited above, § 164).84. As to the examination of the nature of the Convention violation found, the Court reiterates that the question whether the use as evidence of information obtained in violation of Article 8 rendered a trial as a whole unfair contrary to Article 6 has to be determined with regard to all the circumstances of the case, and in particular to the question of respect for the applicant’s defence rights and the quality and importance of the evidence in question (ibid.).85. However, particular considerations apply in respect of the use in criminal proceedings of evidence obtained in breach of Article 3. The use of such evidence, secured as a result of a violation of one of the core and absolute rights guaranteed by the Convention, always raises serious issues as to the fairness of the proceedings, even if the admission of such evidence was not decisive in securing a conviction (see İçöz v. Turkey (dec.), no. 54919/00, 9 January 2003; Jalloh, cited above, §§ 99 and 104; Göçmen v. Turkey, no. 72000/01, §§ 73-74, 17 October 2006; Harutyunyan, cited above, § 63; and Gäfgen, cited above, § 165).Therefore, the use in criminal proceedings of statements obtained as a result of a violation of Article 3 – irrespective of the classification of the treatment as torture, inhuman or degrading treatment – renders the proceedings as a whole automatically unfair, in breach of Article 6 (see Gäfgen, cited above, §§ 166-167 and 173). This also holds true for the use of real evidence obtained as a direct result of acts of torture (ibid., § 173); the admission of such evidence obtained as a result of an act qualified as inhuman treatment in breach of Article 3, but falling short of torture, will only breach Article 6, however, if it has been shown that the breach of Article 3 had a bearing on the outcome of the proceedings against the defendant, that is, had an impact on his or her conviction or sentence (ibid., § 178).The Court is of the view that these principles apply not only where the victim of the treatment contrary to Article 3 is the actual defendant but also where third parties are concerned. It would point out in this connection that it has already had occasion to indicate in Othman (Abu Qatada) v. the United Kingdom (no. 8139/09, §§ 263 and 267, ECHR 2012), with regard more specifically to a flagrant denial of justice, that the use in a trial of evidence obtained by torture would amount to such a denial even where the person from whom the evidence had been thus extracted was a third party.86. The Court examined the issue of evidence in the above-cited Othman case, where it examined, in particular, the question whether the deportation of a Jordanian national to his country of origin, where he claimed he would face conviction on the basis of statements by third parties that had been extracted under torture and would thus be the victim of a flagrant denial of justice, would entail a violation of Article 6 of the Convention. In response to the United Kingdom Government’s argument that the applicant had to establish “beyond reasonable doubt” that the evidence in issue had been obtained by torture, it took the view that it would be unfair to impose on the applicant a burden of proof that went beyond the demonstration of a “real risk” that the evidence in question had been thus obtained (ibid., § 273). The Court set out three reasons why it would be unfair to impose any higher burden of proof on the applicant.First, the Court did not consider that the balance of probabilities test, as applied by the majority of the House of Lords in the above-mentioned A. and others (no. 2) judgment, was appropriate, as that case had concerned not criminal proceedings but proceedings before the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (SIAC) to determine whether the Secretary of State’s suspicions that an individual was involved in terrorism were correct. It further noted that, in any event, the majority of the House of Lords in that judgment had found that the balance of probabilities test was for SIAC itself to apply and that an appellant before SIAC had only to raise a plausible reason that evidence might have been obtained by torture (ibid., § 274). Second, the Court did not consider that the Canadian and German case-law, which had been submitted by the United Kingdom Government (in particular the Singh and El Motassadeq judgments, cited also by the parties in the present case), provided any support for their position (ibid., § 275).Third, describing this as the most important factor, the Court found that it was necessary to have due regard for the special difficulties in proving allegations of torture. It emphasised that torture was uniquely evil, both for its barbarity and its corrupting effect on the criminal process. It was practised in secret, often by experienced interrogators who were skilled at ensuring that it left no visible signs on the victim. All too frequently, those who were charged with ensuring that torture did not occur – courts, prosecutors and medical personnel – were complicit in its concealment. The Court observed that, in a criminal justice system where the courts were independent of the executive, where cases were prosecuted impartially, and where allegations of torture were conscientiously investigated, one might conceivably require a defendant to prove to a high standard that the evidence against him had been obtained by torture. However, in a criminal justice system which was complicit in the very practices which it existed to prevent, such a standard of proof was wholly inappropriate (ibid., § 276).87. As to the standard of proof for the application of the exclusionary rule in respect of evidence allegedly obtained as a result of treatment contrary to Article 3, a number of situations may arise. Firstly, such treatment may be imputed to the authorities of the forum State or to those of a third State and the victim may be the actual defendant or a third party. Furthermore, in some cases the Court itself (see, for example, Levinta v. Moldova, no. 17332/03, 16 December 2008), the courts of the forum State (see, for example, the Harutyunyan judgment, cited above) or the courts of the third State have confirmed the veracity and nature of the alleged ill-treatment; in other cases there has been no such judicial decision.88. The Court will not proceed to examine each of those situations. It is sufficient in the present case for it to observe that, at least in a case where a defendant asks the domestic court to exclude statements obtained in a third State as a result, in his submission, of treatment contrary to Article 3 inflicted on another individual, it is appropriate to follow the approach set out in the Othman judgment, cited above. Accordingly, in any event, where the judicial system of the third State in question does not offer meaningful guarantees of an independent, impartial and serious examination of allegations of torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, it will be necessary and sufficient for the complainant, if the exclusionary rule is to be invoked on the basis of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, to show that there is a “real risk” that the impugned statement was thus obtained. It would be unfair to impose any higher burden of proof on him.89. The domestic court may not then admit the impugned evidence without having first examined the defendant’s arguments concerning it and without being satisfied that, notwithstanding those arguments, no such risk obtains. This is inherent in a court’s responsibility to ensure that those appearing before it are guaranteed a fair hearing, and in particular to verify that the fairness of the proceedings is not undermined by the conditions in which the evidence on which it relies has been obtained (see, mutatis mutandis, Stojkovic v. France and Belgium, no. 25303/08, 7 April 2011, § 55).(b) Application to the present case90. The Court finds it appropriate primarily to examine the applicant’s allegation that, in violation of Article 6 of the Convention, the Belgian courts, in the context of the criminal proceedings against him, had admitted in evidence certain statements by third parties that had been obtained in Morocco using treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention.91. It would first observe that it has been established that the domestic courts refused to apply the exclusionary rule to statements of third parties obtained in Morocco by the Moroccan authorities in the course of criminal proceedings in that country, as can be seen from the reasoning of the Brussels Court of Appeal’s judgment of 19 January 2007 (see paragraphs 36 and 40 above). This has not been disputed by the Government.92. It remains to be determined, in the circumstances of the case, whether the Moroccan judicial system afforded, at the material time, meaningful guarantees of an independent, impartial and serious examination of allegations of torture or inhuman or degrading treatment, and, if not, whether there was a “real risk” that the impugned statements might have been obtained as a result of such means (see paragraph 88 above).93. In the light of the plentiful information before it, the Court has cause to doubt that the Moroccan judicial system did afford such guarantees at the material time. It is at least apparent from that information that this was not the case at the time of the circumstances in question, in so far as the allegations concerned acts committed in the context of general counter-terrorism measures, and, more specifically, in that of the investigations and proceedings that followed the Casablanca bombings of 16 May 2003.94. The Court observes, in this connection, that in its report of 28 November 2005 (see paragraph 53 above) – to which the applicant referred before the Court, as before the domestic courts – Human Rights Watch explained that individuals tried in that context had been denied a fair hearing, that the courts refused, in particular, to order medical examinations of those who claimed to have been tortured, that it was not aware of any prosecution of officials suspected of torture, and that “[o]verall, the pattern of continuing abuses, criticized by various human rights organizations as well as by the U.N. Human Rights Committee, [CCPR/CO/82/MAR] show[ed] that security forces continue[d] to operate in a climate of impunity and disrespect for the law, and that the executive branch continue[d] to exercise considerable influence over the courts”.Similarly, the FIDH report of February 2004, to which the previous report referred (see paragraph 54 above), commented in particular on the hurried nature of the judicial investigation phase and the failure to comply with safeguards enshrined in Moroccan law, such as the right to have a lawyer and to see a doctor, before both the public prosecutor and the investigating judge. It emphasised that the trial courts had systematically dismissed objections based on alleged problems at the police custody and judicial investigation stages and that no application for a medical expert’s report for the purposes of substantiating ill-treatment allegations had been accepted. Amnesty International made the same observation in its report of 24 June 2004 (see paragraph 55 above) – mentioned in the above-cited report of Human Rights Watch. It reported, in particular, that the judicial authorities appeared to have repeatedly dismissed allegations of torture or ill-treatment, without ordering investigations or medical examinations. Amnesty International further observed that statements obtained by torture or ill-treatment were often used in court as evidence to obtain convictions, even though the accused generally retracted them in the courtroom. It added that during their trials many accused challenged, on the ground that it had been obtained by duress, evidence against them taken from statements made by others who had been arrested and detained on similar charges, and that their requests for confrontation with witnesses were denied by the courts on a systematic basis.95. In the same vein, the United Nations Committee against Torture and the United Nations Human Rights Committee, in reports covering the relevant period (paragraph 50-51 above), referred to numerous allegations of ill-treatment imputed to agents of the State and expressed concern about the impunity that they enjoyed. The former also noted that there was no provision of criminal law prohibiting a statement obtained under torture from being invoked as evidence in any proceedings, whilst the latter was concerned that the independence of the judiciary was not fully guaranteed.96. The Court concludes from the foregoing that, in order to seek the application of the exclusionary rule as regards statements taken in Morocco by the Moroccan authorities, it was sufficient for the applicant to demonstrate before the domestic court that there was a “real risk” that they had been obtained using torture or inhuman or degrading treatment.97. In this connection, the Court notes that the applicant alleged before the domestic courts that the impugned statements emanated from individuals who were suspected of involvement in the Casablanca bombings of 16 May 2003, and who had been interrogated in Morocco in the context of the ensuing investigations and proceedings. He argued that the country had been harshly criticised by governmental and non-governmental organisations for acts of torture and ill-treatment inflicted systematically on individuals arrested after those events, referring in particular to the above-mentioned report of Human Rights Watch. He explained that those who had given the statements in question had complained of being subjected to acts of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. He added that the Moroccan authorities had not carried out an investigation into those allegations. He further argued that the Moroccan proceedings had been conducted in a hurried manner.The Brussels Court of Appeal took the view, however, that by merely “citing in general terms” various reports of human rights organisations, the applicant had not adduced any concrete evidence that would be capable of giving rise in the present case to “reasonable doubt” as to the violence, torture or inhuman or degrading treatment that had allegedly been inflicted on the individuals interviewed in Morocco (see paragraph 36 above).98. The Court, for its part, takes that view that since those statements emanated from suspects interrogated in Morocco in the context of investigations and proceedings following the Casablanca bombings of 16 May 2003, the above-mentioned reports established the existence of a “real risk” that they had been obtained using treatment contrary to Article 3 of the Convention. It can be seen from those reports that ill-treatment for the purposes of extracting confessions was widely practised against such suspects.In 2004 the United Nations Human Rights Committee thus expressed concern about the numerous allegations of torture and ill-treatment against detainees in Morocco, as did the United Nations Committee against Torture, which specifically noted the increase in those allegations that implicated the National Surveillance Directorate (see paragraphs 50 and 52 above). In its final observations on the fourth periodic report of Morocco – adopted, however, after the domestic courts had given a final decision in the applicant’s case –, the Committee against Torture reiterated that concern, mentioning more particularly the use of such treatment during interrogations of individuals suspected of terrorism with the aim of extracting confessions from them. It further referred to allegations that pointed to a consistent pattern, “whereby suspects [were] arrested by plain-clothes officers who [did] not clearly identify themselves, taken in for questioning and then held in secret detention facilities, which in practice amount[ed] to incommunicado detention. The suspects [were] not officially registered and [were] subjected to torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. They [were] held in these conditions for weeks at a time without being brought before a judge and without judicial supervision. Their families [were] not notified of their arrest, of their movements or of their whereabouts until such time as they [were] transferred to police custody in order to sign confessions that they ha[d] made under torture. It [was ] only then that they [were] officially registered and their cases [were] processed through the regular justice system on the basis of falsified dates and information ...” (see paragraph 51 above).In addition, it can be seen from the report of Human Rights Watch that many of the suspected Islamists who were detained in the weeks following the Casablanca bombings “were held for days or weeks in secret detention, where the police subjected them to various forms of illtreatment and in some cases to torture in order to extract confessions” (see paragraph 53 above). The FIDH reported numerous cases of arbitrary detention in secret centres, where the interrogations were “carried out in breach of the Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, adopted by the United Nations in 1975, and the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment”. It pointed out that at the Témara centre, where most prisoners were taken after their arrest, ill-treatment, violence and torture were common practice. The cells, situated in the basement, were lit day and night and when they moved around, as well as during interrogation, which often lasted a very long time, the suspects were blindfolded. It added that insults and blows were commonplace, with prisoners under interrogation sometimes being stripped naked, and that several cases of electrical torture and rape had been reported. A number of prisoners had signed statements under torture. The FIDH also reproduced various detailed testimonies describing the poor conditions of detention and mentioning, in particular, beatings, blows, rape, cigarette burns, insults, humiliations, spitting, threats, blackmail, placement in solitary confinement, endless questioning, sleep deprivation and denial of medical care (see paragraph 55 above). Amnesty International gave a similar description of treatment inflicted on detainees at the Témara centre. It indicated that many former prisoners had complained of being tortured or ill-treated during interrogation sessions, in an attempt to extract confessions or information from them or to force them to sign or thumb-print statements which they rejected or denied. It added that in many cases the statements had been signed or thumb-printed after the detainees had been transferred from Témara to a police station, where they were threatened with being returned to Témara and with further torture should they refuse to comply (see paragraph 55 above).99. In the Court’s view, the foregoing information, which emanates from diverse, objective and concurring sources, establishes that there was, at the material time, a “real risk” that the impugned statements had been obtained in Morocco using treatment prohibited by Article 3 of the Convention. Article 6 of the Convention thus required the domestic courts not to admit them in evidence, unless they had first verified, in view of elements specific to the case, that they had not been obtained in such manner. As indicated above, in dismissing the applicant’s request for the exclusion of those statements, the Brussels Court of Appeal merely found that he had not adduced any “concrete evidence” that would be capable of raising “reasonable doubt” in this connection.This is sufficient for the Court to find that there has been a violation of Article 6 in the present case, without it being necessary to ascertain whether, as the applicant contends, that provision has also been breached for other reasons....FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT, UNANIMOUSLY,...2.

The Court considers that it is not necessary to decide whether the case should be struck out of its list of cases in accordance with the Government’s request and in view of the applicant’s admission to Belgium, since it is, in any event, inadmissible for the reasons set out below.A. Complaint under Article 3 of the Convention24. The applicant complained that subjecting him to an exclusion order amounted to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in breach of this provision, since it had led to him committing a criminal offence by being in the Netherlands, even though there was nowhere else for him to go. Article 3 reads:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”25. The Court reiterates that, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person in question, if expelled, would face a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 3 in the receiving country, that provision implies the obligation not to expel the person to that country (see, inter alia, Chahal v. the United Kingdom, 15 November 1996, §§ 73-74, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1996-V, and A. v. the Netherlands, no. 4900/06, § 141, 20 July 2010). There is no doubt that the Government complied with this obligation, as they had no intention of expelling the applicant to the DRC as long as a real risk of his being subjected to treatment in breach of Article 3 existed there. However, it is the applicant’s submission that to subject him to an exclusion order in those circumstances – where he had no choice but to stay in the Netherlands – was a disproportionate measure incompatible with Article 3, as it meant that he was committing a criminal offence by remaining in the Netherlands, and was thus liable to criminal prosecution and conviction.26. According to the Court’s established case-law, in order for ill-treatment to fall within the scope of Article 3 of the Convention, it must attain a minimum level of severity. The assessment of this minimum depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the duration of the treatment, its physical or mental effects and, in some cases, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see Ireland v. the United Kingdom, 18 January 1978, § 162, Series A no. 25, and Jalloh v. Germany [GC], no. 54810/00, § 67, ECHR 2006-IX). The Court has considered treatment to be “inhuman” because, inter alia, it was premeditated, was applied for hours at a stretch and caused either actual bodily injury or intense physical and mental suffering (see Labita v. Italy [GC], no. 26772/95, § 120, ECHR 2000‑IV, and Ramirez Sanchez v. France [GC], no. 59450/00, § 118, ECHR 2006‑IX). Treatment or punishment has been held to be “degrading” when it was such as to arouse in its victims feelings of fear, anguish and inferiority capable of humiliating and debasing them and possibly breaking their physical or moral resistance, or when it was such as to drive the victims to act against their will or conscience (see, inter alia, Keenan v. the United Kingdom, no. 27229/95, § 110, ECHR 2001-III, and Jalloh, cited above, § 68). In a case brought by a conscientious objector, the Court found that the applicant had been subjected to degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 3, having regard to the numerous criminal proceedings brought against him, the cumulative effects of the ensuing criminal convictions and the constant alternation between prosecution and imprisonment, together with the possibility that he would face prosecution for the rest of his life (see Ülke v. Turkey, no. 39437/98, §§ 62-63, 24 January 2006).27. The Court considers at the outset that subjecting a person who cannot be returned to his or her country of origin to an exclusion order does not, by itself and without more, constitute treatment or punishment contrary to Article 3, even if the person’s continued stay in the country concerned in defiance of the exclusion order renders him or her liable to criminal prosecution and conviction. However, an issue under Article 3 may arise if several sets of criminal proceedings were brought against a person subject to an exclusion order and/or if, despite making reasonable efforts to find a third country prepared to admit him or her, that person continues to face the risk of an interminable series of prosecutions and criminal convictions and is helpless to prevent such a predicament.28. In the present case, the Court observes that it appears from the case file that, between the applicant being made subject to an exclusion order on 27 September 2004 and his relocation to Belgium at some point in 2008, criminal proceedings were instituted against him just once. Although it is true that he was convicted of the offence of being in the Netherlands while he knew that he was subject to an exclusion order, the sentence which was imposed on him was suspended. Moreover, it was also decided that this conviction should not trigger the activation of a suspended sentence that had previously been imposed on him (see paragraph 20 above). The Court further notes, firstly, that the reasoning adopted by the Court of Appeal in its first judgment of 21 September 2007 strongly suggests that a suspended sentence was imposed in recognition of the difficult situation in which the applicant found himself (see paragraph 13 above) and, secondly, that it appears from that court’s final judgment of 6 December 2010 that the applicant might not have been found criminally liable had he made certain efforts to comply with his obligation to leave the Netherlands prior to his arrest on 9 May 2006 (see paragraph 20 above). Accordingly, and while account was thus taken of the applicant’s particular situation, it also appears that he was in a position to affect the outcome of the criminal proceedings.29. In view of the foregoing, the Court cannot find that the treatment complained of attained the requisite level of severity to engage Article 3.30. It follows that this complaint is manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.B. Complaint under Article 8 of the Convention31. The applicant complained that the exclusion order entailed a breach of Article 8 of the Convention which, in so far as relevant, provides:“1. Everyone has the right to respect for his ... family life ...”32. The Court reiterates that, pursuant to Article 35 § 1 of the Convention, the Court “may only deal with the matter after all domestic remedies have been exhausted, according to the generally recognised rules of international law.” Further, it has consistently held that domestic remedies cannot be said to have been exhausted when an appeal has been rejected or not allowed because of a procedural mistake on the part of the appellant (see Mahdid and Haddar v. Austria (dec.), no. 74762/01, ECHR 2005‑XIII (extracts)).33. The Court notes that the applicant’s Article 8 grievance in his appeal against the decision of the Minister for Immigration and Integration of 27 May 2005 was not examined by the Regional Court because he had raised it too late (see paragraph 8 above); he had thus failed to comply with the procedural requirements attached to that remedy.34. That being so, the applicant has not validly exhausted the domestic remedies available to him in Dutch law. It follows that this part of the application must be rejected pursuant to Article 35 §§ 1 and 4 of the Convention.C. Complaint under Article 13 of the Convention35. The applicant also complained under Article 13 that he had no effective remedy. Article 13 reads:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”36. The Court firstly reiterates that the provision of Article 13 of the Convention cannot be invoked separately, but only in so far as the main complaint is within the scope of the Convention. If it is to be assumed that the applicant intended to invoke this provision in conjunction with the alleged violations of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention, the Court further reiterates that, according to its case-law, Article 13 applies only where an individual has an “arguable claim” to be the victim of a violation of a Convention right (see Boyle and Rice v. the United Kingdom, 27 April 1988, § 52, Series A no. 131). Having regard to the reasoning and conclusions set out above as regards the complaints under Articles 3 and 8, the Court finds that the applicant has no arguable claim for the purpose of Article 13 of the Convention. It follows that this complaint is also manifestly ill-founded and must be rejected in accordance with Article 35 §§ 3 (a) and 4 of the Convention.For these reasons, the Court, unanimously,Declares the application inadmissible.Done in English and notified in writing on 10 December 2015.Stephen Phillips Luis López Guerra Registrar President', 'date': Timestamp('2015-11-17 00:00:00'), 'File': '001-159389', 'appno': '6107/07', 'doctypebranch': 'ADMISSIBILITY', 'respondent': 'NLD', 'extractedappno': '6107/07;4900/06;54810/00;26772/95;59450/00;27229/95;39437/98;74762/01', 'conclusion': 'Inadmissible (Art. 35) Admissibility criteria;(Art. 35-3-a) Manifestly ill-founded', 'importance': 3, 'kpthesaurus': '350;89;90;192;193;14;236', 'doc_id': '0d626064-8d7e-4835-8a07-28857eba39f7'}, page_content='section 1 of the Convention against Torture (Implementation) Act (Uitvoeringswet Folteringverdrag), and had sentenced him to two and a half years’ imprisonment.6. The Minister for Immigration and Integration made the applicant subject to an exclusion order (ongewenstverklaring) on 27 September 2004, as she considered that he constituted a danger to public order and that the imposition of such an order was in the interest of the Netherlands’ international relations. Staying in the Netherlands whilst knowing or having serious reason to suspect that one is subject to an exclusion order constitutes a criminal offence (Article 197 of the Criminal Code (Wetboek van Strafrecht)). In his objection to the order, the applicant argued, inter alia, that it would – once he had served his prison sentence – expose him to the risk of being arrested at any moment, notwithstanding the fact that there was nowhere else for him to go: Article 3 of the Convention stood in the way of his return to the DRC and no other country was willing to admit him. This would be even more inhumane, as he had no means of subsistence; it was apparently expected that he would spend his days as a tramp.7. The Minister for Immigration and Integration rejected the objection on 27 May 2005. The Minister acknowledged that, on the one hand, the applicant had not been granted lawful residence in the Netherlands and was not eligible for State-sponsored provisions and benefits, while on the other, the authorities’ intention to expel him would not be acted upon as long as his return to the DRC involved a risk of Article 3 of the Convention being violated. However, denying him a residence permit was not considered to be disproportionate. In this context, the Minister found it relevant that there did not appear to be any special circumstances on which to base a conclusion that criminalising the applicant’s stay in the Netherlands, without proceeding with his expulsion within a foreseeable time frame, would be disproportionate. The exclusion order imposed on the applicant was not designed to deprive him of a residence permit which was enabling him to enjoy family life in the Netherlands. After all, neither the applicant nor the members of his family had lawful residence in the Netherlands. The fact that the applicant would or could not be expelled did not mean that his stay should be accepted. Although the applicant would not be expelled for the time being, this did not change the fact that he was still under an obligation to leave the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 11060, 'The Law': 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 3)86. The applicants alleged that the removal of Francine from the Netherlands to Zaïre, and the conditions under which it was carried out, constituted \"inhuman treatment\", contrary to Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3), which provides:\"No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.\"Neither the Commission nor the Government shared this view.A. Arguments before the Court1. The applicants87. The applicants alleged that Francine - who at that time was only 9 years old - had been removed from the Netherlands to Switzerland in the company of a total stranger, who moreover had disappeared without trace from Zürich Airport. She had then been sent on from there to Zaïre on her own.In addition, the Netherlands Government had failed to provide for a responsible person to pick her up at the airport in Kinshasa, thus exposing her to the risk of falling into the hands of persons who might not have her best interests at heart. Although admittedly Francine had been received properly, that was in no way due to the actions of the Netherlands authorities.This situation was aggravated by the length of time which Francine’s ordeal had taken. It had begun on 29 December 1993, when Francine was refused access to the Netherlands. It had ended no sooner than 7 January 1994, the date on which she had arrived in Kinshasa, after which she had remained in the hands of the immigration authorities for another day.Bata Nsona’s refusal to accompany Francine back could not be criticised. Bata Nsona had arrived in the Netherlands in 1989, claiming refugee status; the Government had granted her a residence permit on humanitarian grounds in 1992, which was relatively quick. In the applicants’ submission this implied recognition that Bata Nsona herself ran a real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment if she were forced to return to Zaïre. Moreover, in the present case she would have been bearing a Zaïrean passport which the Netherlands authorities themselves had found to have been tampered with.The applicants claimed that they could not be held responsible for having caused the situation to arise by failing to apply for a provisional residence visa for Francine while the latter was still in Zaïre. It was not possible for them to do so, since Bata Nsona was not Francine’s guardian; nor could she apply for guardianship as long as Francine remained resident in Zaïre.2. The Government88. The Government denied that Francine’s removal to Zaïre had exposed her to any danger of inhuman or degrading treatment. Her position was the same as that of any other Zaïrean citizen who had not been involved in activities aimed at the overthrow of the Zaïrean Government.89. As to the way in which Francine’s removal was effected, the Government drew attention to the fact that she had appeared at the border without a visa and that an attempt had been made to bring her into the Netherlands on a forged or falsified passport. If the applicants had followed the normal immigration procedure, it would have been unnecessary for the Netherlands authorities to refuse Francine access at the border.Secondly, Bata Nsona had been offered the opportunity to accompany Francine back to Zaïre. This she had ultimately refused to do. The immigration authorities had then asked Ms M.M. to escort Francine back; Ms M.M. had likewise been refused access to the country and had been travelling together with Bata Nsona and Francine. Ms M.M. had in fact escorted Francine until Francine’s journey was interrupted in Zürich at the request of the applicants’ lawyer.Finally, on 6 January 1994 - the day on which Francine left Zürich for Kinshasa - the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs had tried to arrange, via the Netherlands Embassy, for Francine to be met at the airport. On 7 January the Netherlands Embassy had asked the Red Cross to assume responsibility for Francine. This request was withdrawn when it emerged that arrangements had been made by Swissair.90. The Government admitted that the conditions of Francine’s return to Zaïre had entailed a certain hardship and that greater care should have been taken to ensure that Francine was accompanied on the journey back. However, the Government were of the view that the case was not such as to engage the responsibility of the Netherlands under Article 3 (art. 3).3. The Commission91. The Commission accepted that Francine’s removal to Zaïre might have exposed her to some hardship but not to the risk of treatment proscribed by Article 3 (art. 3).On the other hand, the Netherlands Government had failed to investigate Francine’s personal situation in Zaïre and had moreover failed to ensure her safety upon her return. Given the fact that Francine was a 9-year-old child allegedly without any living relatives in her country of origin, these were measures which the Government might have been expected to take before removing her. However, this failure to take appropriate action had not caused such hardship as to violate Article 3 (art. 3).B. The Court’s assessment1. General principles92. The applicable principles which emerge from the Court’s case-law are the following:a) States have the right, as a matter of well-established international law and subject to their treaty obligations including Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3), to control the entry, residence and expulsion of aliens (see the Vilvarajah and Others v. the United Kingdom judgment of 30 October 1991, Series A no. 215, p. 34, para. 102).b) Expulsion - or removal - by a Contracting State of a non-national may give rise to an issue under Article 3 (art. 3), and hence engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds have been shown for believing that the person concerned faced a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country to which he or shewas returned (see, mutatis mutandis, the above-mentioned Vilvarajah and Others judgment, p. 34, para. 103).c) Since the nature of the Contracting States’ responsibility under Article 3 (art. 3) in cases of this kind lies in the act of exposing an individual to the risk of ill-treatment, the existence of the risk must be assessed primarily with reference to those facts which were known or ought to have been known to the Contracting State at the time of the expulsion (or, as in the present case, the removal); the Court is not precluded, however, from having regard to information which comes to light subsequent to the expulsion (or removal). This may be of value in confirming or refuting the appreciation that has been made by the Contracting Party of the well-foundedness or otherwise of the applicants’ fears (see, mutatis mutandis, the Cruz Varas and Others v. Sweden judgment of 20 March 1991, Series A no. 201, p. 30, para. 76).d) Ill-treatment must attain a minimum level of severity if it is to fall within the scope of Article 3 (art. 3). The assessment of this minimum is, in the nature of things, relative; it depends on all the circumstances of the case, such as the nature and context of the treatment, the manner and method of its execution, its duration, its physical and mental effects and, in some instances, the sex, age and state of health of the victim (see, among other authorities, the above-mentioned Cruz Varas and Others judgment, p. 31, para. 83).2. The refusal to allow Francine access to Netherlands territory93. Francine and Bata Nsona arrived at Schiphol Airport on 29 December 1993. Although Bata Nsona had a residence permit, Francine did not; nor did she have any kind of visa which would have entitled her to access to the Netherlands (see paragraph 18 above). The entry of Francine as Bata Nsona’s child in the latter’s passport appeared to be forged (see paragraphs 15, 54 and 55 above).It must therefore be recognised that the Netherlands authorities were in principle entitled to refuse Francine access to the country provided that such refusal was not inconsistent with the obligations of the respondent State under the Convention.3. The way in which Francine’s removal was effected94. After Francine was refused access to the Netherlands, she was taken to the Schiphol Airport Hotel. She stayed there, under the supervision of the Royal Military Constabulary, until her removal was effected on 31 December 1993 in the afternoon (see paragraphs 18 and 24 above).95. On 30 December 1993 the Netherlands authorities offered Bata Nsona the opportunity to accompany Francine on a flight back to Zaïre, on a ticket provided by Swissair. She initially accepted but later changed her mind (see paragraphs 19 and 21 above).96. Before the Court, the applicants drew attention to the fact that Bata Nsona had arrived in the Netherlands in 1989 claiming refugee status. In 1992 she had been granted a residence permit on humanitarian grounds, which according to the applicants reflected recognition by the authorities that Bata Nsona would be in real danger if forced to return to Zaïre.Be that as it may, the fact remains that she arrived on the same flight as Francine, travelling under her own name and on a Zaïrean passport that had apparently been issued in Kinshasa the previous day (see paragraph 15 above).Nor has any evidence been put forward to support the vague suggestion that Bata Nsona might suffer ill-treatment at the hands of the Zaïrean authorities for the reason that the entry of Francine in her passport was irregular.In these circumstances the separation of Francine and Bata Nsona cannot be imputed to the respondent State.97. After Bata Nsona had refused to accompany Francine back to Zaïre, the Netherlands authorities asked another adult to do so (see paragraph 25 above). Before the domestic courts the applicants denied that the person in whose company Francine arrived in Zürich was Ms M.M. but before the Court they no longer did so.On the other hand, the applicants stated before the Court that Bata Nsona and Ms M.M. were strangers. They denied that copies of documents relating to Ms M.M. were found in Bata Nsona’s luggage. The Commission’s file, however, contains a copy of a note by an officer of the Royal Military Constabulary attesting to the fact that such copies were in fact found there (see paragraph 16 above). In these circumstances the Court accepts that the authorities could reasonably assume that there existed a relationship between Ms M.M. and Bata Nsona sufficient to justify entrusting the escorting of Francine back to Kinshasa to Ms M.M.98. Francine and Ms M.M. travelled together as far as Zürich. Whether Ms M.M. flew on to Kinshasa or absconded, as the applicants allege (see paragraph 25 above), the fact is that Francine was allowed to remain at Zürich Airport until 6 January at the request of the applicants’ lawyer (see paragraph 27 above), who must therefore bear part of the responsibility for the length of Francine’s ordeal if not for the fact that she travelled unaccompanied from then on.99. Francine’s seven-day journey back to Kinshasa must have been a distressing experience. She was however in the hands of the Netherlands authorities for as long as she was at Schiphol Airport and in a Swissair nursery while she was in Zürich. In any event it has not been suggested that Francine sustained any damage, however slight, to her mental or physical health.On the facts of the case, the Court finds that the way in which Francine’s removal was effected did not constitute treatment of such a nature as to make it \"inhuman or degrading\" as these expressions are to be understood in the context of Article 3 (art. 3).4. The risk to which Francine was exposed upon return to Zaïre100. This aspect of the case revolves around the allegation that the Government did not take sufficient account of the possibility that Francine might not be taken proper care of upon her return to Zaïre. It was not alleged that Francine had anything to fear from the Zaïrean authorities.101. When she arrived at Kinshasa Airport on 7 January 1993, Francine was met by a business relation of Swissair, who turned her over to the Zaïrean immigration authorities (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above). The following day she was taken to the home of Mr Mbemba and Ms Bakangadio, with whom she had stayed before travelling to the Netherlands (see paragraph 32 above).On 6 January the Netherlands authorities made an unsuccessful attempt to arrange through the Netherlands Embassy in Kinshasa for Francine to be met. On 7 January the Embassy asked the Red Cross to assume responsibility for Francine. This request was withdrawn when it emerged that other arrangements had been made (see paragraphs 31 and 32 above).102. Given the fact that arrangements were made by Swissair for Francine to be met at Kinshasa Airport and that these proved adequate, the Court is of the opinion that there is insufficient ground for reproaching the Netherlands Government for not having acted with due diligence.5. Conclusion103. The most striking features of the case are the haste with which the Netherlands authorities gave effect to their decision to remove Francine from the Netherlands and their apparent willingness to hand over all responsibility for her welfare as soon as she had left Netherlands territory to others (Ms M.M. and especially Swissair). In a case involving a 9-year-old girl, such an attitude is certainly open to criticism, as the Government in fact admitted (see paragraph 90 above).Nevertheless, in the circumstances of the present case the Netherlands cannot be held responsible for treating Francine in such a way as to warrant a finding that she has been the victim of \"inhuman or degrading treatment\" or for exposing her to the danger thereof.There has accordingly not been a violation of Article 3 (art. 3).II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 8 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 8)A. The Government’s preliminary objection104. The Government stated that since Bata Nsona had been appointed temporary guardian of Francine (27 June 1995 - see paragraph 45 above), and since Francine had been granted a residence permit to live in the Netherlands as Bata Nsona’s foster child (1 December 1995 - see paragraph 46 above), the relationship between Bata Nsona and Francine had been recognised by law.In the Government’s contention, this had \"deprived the applicants’ complaints in respect of Article 8 (art. 8) of any substance whatever, and ... they [could] no longer be regarded as victims in this regard\".105. The events relied on by the Government occurred after the Commission adopted its report (2 March 1995 - see paragraph 84 above). They therefore could not have been invoked at an earlier stage of the proceedings and there is no estoppel.106. The word \"victim\" in the context of Article 25 of the Convention (art. 25) denotes the person directly affected by the act or omission in issue, the existence of a violation of the Convention being conceivable even in the absence of prejudice; prejudice is relevant only in the context of Article 50 (art. 50). Consequently, a measure by a public authority reversing or mitigating the effect of the act or omission alleged to be in breach of the Convention in principle deprives such a person of his status as a victim only where the national authorities have acknowledged, either expressly or in substance, and then afforded redress for, such breach (see, among many other authorities, the Lüdi v. Switzerland judgment of 15 June 1992, Series A no. 238, p. 18, para. 34).107. It is true that the Rotterdam District Court’s decision of 27 June 1995 appointing Bata Nsona as Francine’s temporary guardian and the grant of a residence permit to Francine on 1 December 1995 put an end to the situation complained of by the applicants. However, it does not appear that these decisions were intended to put an end to, and afford redress for, any violation of the Convention; they did not reverse or compensate for any of the measures which led to the applicants’ separation between 31 December 1993 and 12 January 1995 (see, mutatis mutandis, the Moustaquim v. Belgium judgment of 18 February 1991, Series A no. 193, p. 17, para. 33). Indeed, far from acknowledging a violation, the Government maintained before the Court that no breach of Article 8 (art. 8) had taken place.The preliminary objection must therefore be dismissed.B. The merits of the complaint108. The applicants alleged that Francine was prevented from establishing \"family life\" with her only surviving relative, contrary to Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8), which provides:\"1. Everyone has the right to respect for his private and family life, his home and his correspondence.2. There shall be no interference by a public authority with the exercise of this right except such as is in accordance with the law and is necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security, public safety or the economic well-being of the country, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.\"Neither the Government nor the Commission accepted this allegation.1. Arguments before the Courta) The applicants109. According to the applicants, family life, or at least a beginning of family life, existed between them at the time of the events complained of. They stated that Bata Nsona was Francine’s closest surviving relative, being the sister of Francine’s mother Ndombe Nsona. The applicants’ family ties were in their view sufficiently proved by the record of Bata Nsona’s interview with the immigration authorities in 1989 (see paragraph 11 above), in which her statement was recorded to the effect that at that time she had a sister called Ndombe, and by the handwritten document claimed to be Ndombe Nsona’s will (see paragraph 12 above).b) The Government110. The Government stated that the Netherlands authorities had been confronted from the outset with uncertainty as to whether, and in what way, Francine was related to other persons involved in the case. The applicants had themselves contributed to this uncertainty by attempting to pass Francine off as Bata Nsona’s daughter (see paragraph 15 above).Before travelling to the Netherlands, Francine had lived for the most part with Mr Mbemba and Ms Bakangadio. It had been claimed that they were relatives of a business associate of Francine’s late father but it had also been suggested that they might even be her parents. Mr Mbemba and Ms Bakangadio had actually claimed to be unaware of Bata Nsona’s very existence, and a fortiori of any request made to her by Francine’s mother (see paragraph 13 above). Moreover, no death certificate was ever produced for either of Francine’s parents (see paragraph 10 above).According to the Government, there had been no family life between Francine and Bata Nsona \"in a form protected by Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8)\".c) The Commission111. The Commission confined itself to observing that when Francine arrived in the Netherlands, she was falsely claimed to be Bata Nsona’s child (see paragraph 15 above). It also considered the allegation that Francine was in fact Bata Nsona’s niece to be unsubstantiated. There had therefore, in its opinion, been no interference with the applicants’ right to respect for their family life.2. The Court’s assessment112. Upon arrival at Schiphol Airport the applicants presented a Zaïrean passport in the name of Bata Nsona, apparently issued the previous day, in which Francine had been entered as her child. When this entry was found by the Royal Military Constabulary to be apparently forged, the applicants admitted that Francine was in fact not Bata Nsona’s daughter and claimed instead that she was her niece (see paragraph 15 above). Such has been their claim ever since.113. In the Court’s opinion, whatever the true situation, the applicants could reasonably have been expected to disclose it to the Netherlands immigration authorities immediately upon arrival. Instead they resorted to deceit. The Netherlands authorities cannot be blamed, once this was discovered, for refusing to accept allegations unsupported by evidence.114. In the circumstances of the present case no interference with the applicants’ right to respect for their family life can be imputed to the respondent State.There has accordingly been no violation of Article 8 (art. 8).III. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 13 OF THE CONVENTION (art. 13)115. In their application to the Commission, the applicants also relied on Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13).In their letters of 28 June and 19 July 1995 referring the case to the Court under Article 48 of the Convention (art. 48) (as amended in respect of the Netherlands by Article 5 of Protocol No. 9 (P9-5)), the applicants stated that they wished to confine the scope of the case to the alleged violations of Articles 3 and 8 of the Convention (art. 3, art. 8).116. The Court does not find it necessary on this occasion to give a general ruling on the question whether it is permissible for an applicant to limit a referral to the Court to some of the issues on which the Commission has stated its opinion (see, mutatis mutandis, the Loizidou v. Turkey (preliminary objections) judgment of 23 March 1995, Series A no. 310, pp. 20-21, para. 54).This is because in any event neither the Commission nor the respondent Government have offered any argument on the question whether there has been a violation of Article 13 (art. 13), and the Court sees no need to consider it of its own motion.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Holds by eight votes to one that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3);2. Dismisses unanimously the Government’s preliminary objection in respect of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8);3. Holds by eight votes to one that there has been no violation of Article 8 of the Convention (art. 8);4. Holds unanimously that it is not necessary to examine whether there has been a violation of Article 13 of the Convention (art. 13).Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 28 November 1996.Rudolf BERNHARDTPresidentHerbert PETZOLDRegistrarIn accordance with Article 51 para. 2 of the Convention (art. 51-2) and Rule 55 para. 2 of Rules of Court B, the dissenting opinion of Mr De Meyer is annexed to this judgment.R.B.H.P.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE DE MEYER(Translation)The risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the country to which a person is returned[4] is not the only circumstance in which removal of a foreign national may give rise to an issue under Article 3 of the Convention (art. 3).What gives rise to such an issue in the present case is the Netherlands authorities’ \"haste\"[5] to remove a 9-year-old girl, without taking sufficient care in examining her rather uncertain personal and family circumstances[6] and handing over \"all responsibility for her welfare as soon as she had left Netherlands territory to others\"[7].This was not merely an \"attitude\" which was \"open to criticism\"[8], but was above all, in my opinion, treatment that it is difficult to consider human.Admittedly, no serious harm seems to have befallen the child so summarily removed, and she was allowed to join the other applicant one year later.

       " Document(metadata={'Word Count': 3604, 'The Law': 'I. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 3 OF THE CONVENTION35. The applicant contended that the United Kingdom had failed to secure his right not to be tortured, contrary to Article 3 of the Convention read in conjunction with Articles 1 and 13.Article 3 provides:“No one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.”Article 1 provides:“The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in Section I of [the] Convention.”Article 13 provides:“Everyone whose rights and freedoms as set forth in [the] Convention are violated shall have an effective remedy before a national authority notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity.”He submitted that, correctly interpreted, the above provisions taken together required the United Kingdom to assist one of its citizens in obtaining an effective remedy for torture against another State. The grant of immunity from civil suit to the State of Kuwait had, however, frustrated this purpose.36. The Government submitted that the complaint under Article 3 failed on three grounds. First, the torture was alleged to have taken place outside the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction. Secondly, any positive obligation deriving from Articles 1 and 3 could extend only to the prevention of torture, not to the provision of compensation. Thirdly, the grant of immunity to Kuwait was not in any way incompatible with the obligations under the Convention.37. The Court reiterates that the engagement undertaken by a Contracting State under Article 1 of the Convention is confined to “securing” (“reconnaître” in the French text) the listed rights and freedoms to persons within its own “jurisdiction” (see Soering v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 7 July 1989, Series A no. 161, pp. 33-34, § 86).38. It is true that, taken together, Articles 1 and 3 place a number of positive obligations on the High Contracting Parties, designed to prevent and provide redress for torture and other forms of ill-treatment. Thus, in A. v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 23 September 1998, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1998-VI, p. 2699, § 22) the Court held that, by virtue of these two provisions, States are required to take certain measures to ensure that individuals within their jurisdiction are not subjected to torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In Aksoy v. Turkey (judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2287, § 98) it was established that Article 13 in conjunction with Article 3 impose an obligation on States to carry out a thorough and effective investigation of incidents of torture, and in Assenov and Others v. Bulgaria (judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, p. 3290, § 102), the Court held that where an individual raises an arguable claim that he has been seriously ill-treated by the police or other such agents of the State unlawfully and in breach of Article 3, that provision, read in conjunction with the State’s general duty under Article 1 of the Convention to “secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in ... [the] Convention”, requires by implication that there should be an effective official investigation. However, in each case the State’s obligation applies only in relation to ill-treatment allegedly committed within its jurisdiction.39. In Soering, cited above, the Court recognised that Article 3 has some, limited, extraterritorial application, to the extent that the decision by a Contracting State to expel an individual might engage the responsibility of that State under the Convention, where substantial grounds had been shown for believing that the person concerned, if expelled, faced a real risk of being subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in the receiving country. In the judgment it was emphasised, however, that in so far as any liability under the Convention might be incurred in such circumstances, it would be incurred by the expelling Contracting State by reason of its having taken action which had as a direct consequence the exposure of an individual to proscribed ill-treatment (op. cit., pp. 35-36, § 91).40. The applicant does not contend that the alleged torture took place within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom or that the United Kingdom authorities had any causal connection with its occurrence. In these circumstances, it cannot be said that the High Contracting Party was under a duty to provide a civil remedy to the applicant in respect of torture allegedly carried out by the Kuwaiti authorities.41. It follows that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention in the present case.II. ALLEGED VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 6 § 1 OF THE CONVENTION42. The applicant alleged that he was denied access to a court in the determination of his claim against the State of Kuwait and that this constituted a violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention, which provides in its first sentence:“In the determination of his civil rights and obligations or of any criminal charge against him, everyone is entitled to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and impartial tribunal established by law.”43. The Government submitted that Article 6 § 1 did not apply to the proceedings, but that, even if it did, any interference with the right of access to a court was compatible with its provisions.A. Applicability of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention1. Submissions of the parties44. The Government contended that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention had no applicability in the present case on a number of grounds. They pointed out that the applicant had not made any allegation in the domestic courts that the State of Kuwait was responsible for the events of 7 May 1991, when he was severely burned (see paragraph 12 above), and they submitted that it was not therefore open to him to complain before the European Court of a denial of access to a court in respect of those alleged events. In addition, they claimed that Article 6 could not extend to matters outside the State’s jurisdiction, and that as international law required an immunity in the present case, the facts fell outside the jurisdiction of the national courts and, consequently, Article 6. Unlike Osman v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 28 October 1998, Reports 1998-VIII, pp. 3166-67, § 138), the present case concerned a clear, absolute and consistent exclusionary rule of English law. Applying the Osman test, the case fell outside the scope of Article 6.45. The applicant accepted that he had not alleged in the first-instance inter partes hearing on 15 March 1995 (see paragraph 17 above) that the State of Kuwait was responsible for the events of 7 May 1991. He underlined, however, that he had made clear in the Court of Appeal that he would seek to amend his statement of claim to add those events if the claim for immunity failed and he believed that he would have been allowed to make the amendment in those circumstances. As to the jurisdictional point, he observed that torture is a civil wrong in English law and that the United Kingdom asserts jurisdiction over civil wrongs committed abroad in certain circumstances (see paragraph 20 above). The domestic courts accepted jurisdiction over his claims against the individual defendants. His claim against the State of Kuwait was not defeated because of its nature but because of the identity of the defendant. Thus, in the applicant’s submission, Article 6 § 1 was applicable.2. The Court’s assessment46. The Court reiterates its constant case-law to the effect that Article 6 § 1 does not itself guarantee any particular content for “civil rights and obligations” in the substantive law of the Contracting States. It extends only to contestations (disputes) over “civil rights and obligations” which can be said, at least on arguable grounds, to be recognised under domestic law (see Z and Others v. the United Kingdom [GC], no. 29392/95, § 87, ECHR 2001-V, and the authorities cited therein).47. Whether a person has an actionable domestic claim may depend not only on the substantive content, properly speaking, of the relevant civil right as defined under national law but also on the existence of procedural bars preventing or limiting the possibilities of bringing potential claims to court. In the latter kind of case Article 6 § 1 may be applicable. Certainly the Convention enforcement bodies may not create by way of interpretation of Article 6 § 1 a substantive civil right which has no legal basis in the State concerned. However, it would not be consistent with the rule of law in a democratic society or with the basic principle underlying Article 6 § 1 – namely that civil claims must be capable of being submitted to a judge for adjudication – if, for example, a State could, without restraint or control by the Convention enforcement bodies, remove from the jurisdiction of the courts a whole range of civil claims or confer immunities from civil liability on large groups or categories of persons (see Fayed v. the United Kingdom, judgment of 21 September 1994, Series A no. 294-B, pp. 49-50, § 65).48. The proceedings which the applicant intended to pursue were for damages for personal injury, a cause of action well known to English law. The Court does not accept the Government’s submission that the applicant’s claim had no legal basis in domestic law since any substantive right which might have existed was extinguished by operation of the doctrine of State immunity. It notes that an action against a State is not barred in limine: if the defendant State waives immunity, the action will proceed to a hearing and judgment. The grant of immunity is to be seen not as qualifying a substantive right but as a procedural bar on the national courts’ power to determine the right.49. The Court is accordingly satisfied that there existed a serious and genuine dispute over civil rights. It follows that Article 6 § 1 was applicable to the proceedings in question.B. Compliance with Article 6 § 11. Submissions of the parties50. The Government contended that the restriction imposed on the applicant’s right of access to a court pursued a legitimate aim and was proportionate. The 1978 Act reflected the provisions of the Basle Convention (see paragraph 22 above), which in turn gave expression to universally applicable principles of public international law and, as the Court of Appeal had found, there was no evidence of a change in customary international law in this respect. Article 6 § 1 of the Convention could not be interpreted so as to compel a Contracting State to deny immunity to and assert jurisdiction over a non-Contracting State. Such a conclusion would be contrary to international law and would impose irreconcilable obligations on the States that had ratified both the Convention and the Basle Convention.There were other, traditional means of redress for wrongs of this kind available to the applicant, namely diplomatic representations or an inter-State claim.51. The applicant submitted that the restriction on his right of access to a court did not serve a legitimate aim and was disproportionate. The House of Lords in ex parte Pinochet (No. 3) (see paragraph 34 above) had accepted that the prohibition of torture had acquired the status of a jus cogens norm in international law and that torture had become an international crime. In these circumstances there could be no rational basis for allowing sovereign immunity in a civil action when immunity would not be a defence in criminal proceedings arising from the same facts.Other than civil proceedings against the State of Kuwait, he complained that there was no effective means of redress available to him. He had attempted to make use of diplomatic channels but the Government refused to assist him, and although he had obtained judgment by default against the Sheikh, the judgment could not be executed because the Sheikh had no ascertainable recoverable assets in the United Kingdom.2. The Court’s assessment52. In Golder v. the United Kingdom (judgment of 21 February 1975, Series A no. 18, pp. 13-18, §§ 28-36) the Court held that the procedural guarantees laid down in Article 6 concerning fairness, publicity and promptness would be meaningless in the absence of any protection for the pre-condition for the enjoyment of those guarantees, namely, access to a court. It established this as an inherent aspect of the safeguards enshrined in Article 6, referring to the principles of the rule of law and the avoidance of arbitrary power which underlie much of the Convention. Thus, Article 6 § 1 secures to everyone the right to have any claim relating to his civil rights and obligations brought before a court.53. The right of access to a court is not, however, absolute, but may be subject to limitations; these are permitted by implication since the right of access by its very nature calls for regulation by the State. In this respect, the Contracting States enjoy a certain margin of appreciation, although the final decision as to the observance of the Convention’s requirements rests with the Court. It must be satisfied that the limitations applied do not restrict or reduce the access left to the individual in such a way or to such an extent that the very essence of the right is impaired. Furthermore, a limitation will not be compatible with Article 6 § 1 if it does not pursue a legitimate aim and if there is no reasonable relationship of proportionality between the means employed and the aim sought to be achieved (see Waite and Kennedy v. Germany [GC], no. 26083/94, § 59, ECHR 1999-I).54. The Court must first examine whether the limitation pursued a legitimate aim. It notes in this connection that sovereign immunity is a concept of international law, developed out of the principle par in parem non habet imperium, by virtue of which one State shall not be subject to the jurisdiction of another State. The Court considers that the grant of sovereign immunity to a State in civil proceedings pursues the legitimate aim of complying with international law to promote comity and good relations between States through the respect of another State’s sovereignty.55. The Court must next assess whether the restriction was proportionate to the aim pursued. It reiterates that the Convention has to be interpreted in the light of the rules set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969, and that Article 31 § 3 (c) of that treaty indicates that account is to be taken of “any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties”. The Convention, including Article 6, cannot be interpreted in a vacuum. The Court must be mindful of the Convention’s special character as a human rights treaty, and it must also take the relevant rules of international law into account (see, mutatis mutandis, Loizidou v. Turkey (merits), judgment of 18 December 1996, Reports 1996-VI, p. 2231, § 43). The Convention should so far as possible be interpreted in harmony with other rules of international law of which it forms part, including those relating to the grant of State immunity.56. It follows that measures taken by a High Contracting Party which reflect generally recognised rules of public international law on State immunity cannot in principle be regarded as imposing a disproportionate restriction on the right of access to a court as embodied in Article 6 § 1. Just as the right of access to a court is an inherent part of the fair trial guarantee in that Article, so some restrictions on access must likewise be regarded as inherent, an example being those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.57. The Court notes that the 1978 Act, applied by the English courts so as to afford immunity to Kuwait, complies with the relevant provisions of the 1972 Basle Convention, which, while placing a number of limitations on the scope of State immunity as it was traditionally understood, preserves it in respect of civil proceedings for damages for personal injury unless the injury was caused in the territory of the forum State (see paragraph 22 above). Except insofar as it affects claims for damages for torture, the applicant does not deny that the above provision reflects a generally accepted rule of international law. He asserts, however, that his claim related to torture, and contends that the prohibition of torture has acquired the status of a jus cogens norm in international law, taking precedence over treaty law and other rules of international law.58. Following the decision to uphold Kuwait’s claim to immunity, the domestic courts were never required to examine evidence relating to the applicant’s allegations, which have, therefore, never been proved. However, for the purposes of the present judgment, the Court accepts that the ill-treatment alleged by the applicant against Kuwait in his pleadings in the domestic courts, namely, repeated beatings by prison guards over a period of several days with the aim of extracting a confession (see paragraph 11 above), can properly be categorised as torture within the meaning of Article 3 of the Convention (see Selmouni v. France [GC], no. 25803/94, ECHR 1999-V, and Aksoy, cited above).59. Within the Convention system it has long been recognised that the right under Article 3 not to be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment enshrines one of the fundamental values of democratic society. It is an absolute right, permitting of no exception in any circumstances (see, for example, Aksoy, cited above, p. 2278, § 62, and the cases cited therein). Of all the categories of ill-treatment prohibited by Article 3, “torture” has a special stigma, attaching only to deliberate inhuman treatment causing very serious and cruel suffering (ibid., pp. 2278-79, § 63, and see also the cases referred to in paragraphs 38-39 above).60. Other areas of public international law bear witness to a growing recognition of the overriding importance of the prohibition of torture. Thus, torture is forbidden by Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires, by Article 2, that each State Party should take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent torture in any territory under its jurisdiction, and, by Article 4, that all acts of torture should be made offences under the State Party’s criminal law (see paragraphs 25-29 above). In addition, there have been a number of judicial statements to the effect that the prohibition of torture has attained the status of a peremptory norm or jus cogens. For example, in its judgment of 10 December 1998 in Furundzija (see paragraph 30 above), the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia referred, inter alia, to the foregoing body of treaty rules and held that “[b]ecause of the importance of the values it protects, this principle [proscribing torture] has evolved into a peremptory norm or jus cogens, that is, a norm that enjoys a higher rank in the international hierarchy than treaty law and even ‘ordinary’ customary rules”. Similar statements have been made in other cases before that tribunal and in national courts, including the House of Lords in the case of ex parte Pinochet (No. 3) (see paragraph 34 above).61. While the Court accepts, on the basis of these authorities, that the prohibition of torture has achieved the status of a peremptory norm in international law, it observes that the present case concerns not, as in Furundzija and Pinochet, the criminal liability of an individual for alleged acts of torture, but the immunity of a State in a civil suit for damages in respect of acts of torture within the territory of that State. Notwithstanding the special character of the prohibition of torture in international law, the Court is unable to discern in the international instruments, judicial authorities or other materials before it any firm basis for concluding that, as a matter of international law, a State no longer enjoys immunity from civil suit in the courts of another State where acts of torture are alleged. In particular, the Court observes that none of the primary international instruments referred to (Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and Articles 2 and 4 of the UN Convention) relates to civil proceedings or to State immunity.62. It is true that in its Report on Jurisdictional Immunities of States and their Property (see paragraphs 23-24 above) the working group of the International Law Commission noted, as a recent development in State practice and legislation on the subject of immunities of States, the argument increasingly put forward that immunity should be denied in the case of death or personal injury resulting from acts of a State in violation of human rights norms having the character of jus cogens, particularly the prohibition on torture. However, as the working group itself acknowledged, while national courts had in some cases shown some sympathy for the argument that States were not entitled to plead immunity where there had been a violation of human rights norms with the character of jus cogens, in most cases (including those cited by the applicant in the domestic proceedings and before the Court) the plea of sovereign immunity had succeeded.63. The ILC working group went on to note developments, since those decisions, in support of the argument that a State may not plead immunity in respect of human rights violations: first, the exception to immunity adopted by the United States in the amendment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) which had been applied by the United States courts in two cases; secondly, the ex parte Pinochet (No. 3) judgment in which the House of Lords “emphasised the limits of immunity in respect of gross human rights violations by State officials”. The Court does not, however, find that either of these developments provides it with a firm basis on which to conclude that the immunity of States ratione personae is no longer enjoyed in respect of civil liability for claims of acts of torture, let alone that it was not enjoyed in 1996 at the time of the Court of Appeal’s judgment in the present case.64. As to the amendment to the FSIA, the very fact that the amendment was needed would seem to confirm that the general rule of international law remained that immunity attached even in respect of claims of acts of official torture. Moreover, the amendment is circumscribed in its scope: the offending State must be designated as a State sponsor of acts of terrorism, and the claimant must be a national of the United States. The effect of the FSIA is further limited in that after judgment has been obtained, the property of a foreign State is immune from attachment or execution unless one of the statutory exceptions applies (see paragraph 24 above).65. As to the ex parte Pinochet (No. 3) judgment (see paragraph 34 above), the Court notes that the majority of the House of Lords held that, after the UN Convention and even before, the international prohibition against official torture had the character of jus cogens or a peremptory norm and that no immunity was enjoyed by a torturer from one Torture Convention State from the criminal jurisdiction of another. But, as the working group of the ILC itself acknowledged, that case concerned the immunity ratione materiae from criminal jurisdiction of a former head of State, who was at the material time physically within the United Kingdom. As the judgments in the case made clear, the conclusion of the House of Lords did not in any way affect the immunity ratione personae of foreign sovereign States from the civil jurisdiction in respect of such acts (see in particular, the judgment of Lord Millett, mentioned in paragraph 34 above). In so holding, the House of Lords cited with approval the judgments of the Court of Appeal in Al-Adsani itself.66. The Court, while noting the growing recognition of the overriding importance of the prohibition of torture, does not accordingly find it established that there is yet acceptance in international law of the proposition that States are not entitled to immunity in respect of civil claims for damages for alleged torture committed outside the forum State. The 1978 Act, which grants immunity to States in respect of personal injury claims unless the damage was caused within the United Kingdom, is not inconsistent with those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity.67. In these circumstances, the application by the English courts of the provisions of the 1978 Act to uphold Kuwait’s claim to immunity cannot be said to have amounted to an unjustified restriction on the applicant’s access to a court.It follows that there has been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention in this case.FOR THESE REASONS, THE COURT1. Holds unanimously that there has been no violation of Article 3 of the Convention;2. Holds by nine votes to eight that there has been no violation of Article 6 § 1 of the Convention.Done in English and in French, and delivered at a public hearing in the Human Rights Building, Strasbourg, on 21 November 2001.Luzius Wildhaber President Paul Mahoney RegistrarIn accordance with Article 45 § 2 of the Convention and Rule 74 § 2 of the Rules of Court, the following separate opinions are annexed to this judgment:(a) concurring opinion of Mr Zupančič;(b) concurring opinion of Mr Pellonpää joined by Sir Nicolas Bratza;(c) joint dissenting opinion of Mr Rozakis and Mr Caflisch joined by Mr Wildhaber, Mr Costa, Mr Cabral Barreto and Mrs Vajić;(d) dissenting opinion of Mr Ferrari Bravo;(e) dissenting opinion of Mr Loucaides.L.W.P.J.M.CONCURRING OPINION OF JUDGE ZUPANČIČI concur with the majority’s opinion in this case.Here, I simply offer another example illustrating the appropriateness of the majority’s decision, namely a pertinent comparison deriving from a positive and recent source of public international law.Article 9 of the United Nations Convention against Torture [Kuwait is a signatory to CAT (“With reservations [only] as to Article 20 and the provision of paragraph 1 from Article 30 of the Convention”) as of 8 March 1996, as is the United Kingdom, as of 15 March 1985; it ratified CAT on 8 December 1998. For other details see, for example, http://www.un.org/Depts/Treaty] (“CAT”) provides as follows:States Parties shall afford one another the greatest measure of assistance in connection with criminal proceedings brought in respect of any of the offences referred to in Article 4 [Article 4 of CAT: “Each State Party shall ensure that all acts of torture are offences under its criminal law. The same shall apply to an attempt to commit torture and to an act by any person which constitutes complicity or participation in torture. Each State Party shall make these offences punishable by appropriate penalties which take into account their grave nature.”], including the supply of all evidence at their disposal necessary for the proceedings.States Parties shall carry out their obligations under paragraph 1 of this article in conformity with any treaties on mutual judicial assistance that may exist between them.” [Emphasis added]There is a striking difference in CAT between the strict and compulsory provisions concerning the enforcement of criminal law’s (substantive and procedural) proscription of torture as a criminal offence and the above rather muted provision of paragraph 1 of Article 9.Another remarkable clause of CAT is Article 5 which provides:“1. Each State Party shall take such measures as may be necessary to establish its [criminal] jurisdiction over the offences referred to in Article 4 in the following cases:(a) When the offences are committed in any territory under its jurisdiction or on board a ship or aircraft registered in that State;(b) When the alleged offender is a national of that State;(c) When the victim is a national of that State if that State considers it appropriate. [This is the criminal aspect of the situation in the present case. Clearly, CAT does not require the State Party (here the United Kingdom) to establish even criminal jurisdiction in such a case. It leaves it to its discretion. The compelling reasons for discretionary exclusion of criminal jurisdiction apply a fortiori to the issue of civil jurisdiction. Hence, the cited provision of Article 9, § 1, supra] [Emphasis added]2.

I would like to add the following further considerations.There is much wisdom in the speech of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith who, on behalf of the Court of Appeal, called for a “moment’s reflection” to consider the practical consequences which would have followed from the acceptance of the applicant’s argument. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith continued (paragraph 18 of the judgment):“... The courts in the United Kingdom are open to all who seek their help, whether they are British citizens or not. A vast number of people come to this country each year seeking refuge and asylum, and many of these allege that they have been tortured in the country whence they came. Some of these claims are no doubt justified, others are more doubtful. Those who are presently charged with the responsibility for deciding whether applicants are genuine refugees have a difficult enough task, but at least they know much of the background and surrounding circumstances against which the claim is made. The court would be in no such position. The foreign States would be unlikely to submit to the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom court, and in its absence the court would have no means of testing the claim or making a just determination. ...”Similar consequences could have ensued in other jurisdictions. The somewhat paradoxical result, had the minority’s view prevailed, could have been that precisely those States which so far have been most liberal in accepting refugees and asylum-seekers, would have had imposed upon them the additional burden of guaranteeing access to a court for the determination of perhaps hundreds of refugees’ civil claims for compensation for alleged torture. Even if the finding of a violation of Article 6 in this case had not had a “chilling effect” on the readiness of the Contracting States to accept refugees – a consequence which I would not totally exclude – the question of the effectiveness of the access in the circumstances outlined by Lord Justice Stuart-Smith would inevitably have arisen.It is established case-law that mere access to a court without the possibility of having judgments executed is not sufficient under Article 6. In Hornsby v. Greece (judgment of 19 March 1997, Reports of Judgments and Decisions 1997-II) the Court stated that “the right to institute proceedings before courts in civil matters” is only one aspect of the “right to a court” (pp. 510-11, § 40). That right would, however,“... be illusory if a Contracting State’s domestic legal system allowed a final, binding judicial decision to remain inoperative to the detriment of one party.

Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the ‘trial’ for the purposes of Article 6 ...” (ibid.).The acceptance of the applicant’s argument concerning access to a court would thus have required a possibility of having judgments – probably often default judgments – delivered in torture cases executed against respondent States. This in turn would raise the question whether the traditionally strong immunity of public property from execution would also have had to be regarded as incompatible with Article 6. It would seem that this indeed would have been the inevitable consequence of the acceptance of the minority’s line. If immunity from jurisdiction were to be regarded as incompatible with Article 6 because of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture, which prevails over all other international obligations not having that same hierarchical status, it presumably would also have to prevail over rules concerning immunity from execution. Consequently, the Contracting States would have had to allow attachment and execution against public property of respondent States if the effectiveness of access to a court could not otherwise be guaranteed.The acceptance of the applicant’s argument indeed would have opened the door to much more far-reaching consequences than did the amendment to the United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, which made it possible for United States nationals to raise damage claims based, inter alia, on torture against specifically designated States (see paragraph 24 of the judgment). As appears from the plaintiff’s futile efforts of execution in Flatow v. the Islamic Republic of Iran [Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran (999 F. Supp. 1 (D.D.C. 1998)); Flatow v. the Islamic Republic of Iran and Others (76 F. Supp. 2d 16, 18 (D.D.C. 1999)). See also 93 American Journal of International Law (AJIL)181 (1999)], this narrowly limited statutory amendment did not affect the immunity of a foreign State’s public property from attachment and execution, causing the District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth to characterise the plaintiff’s original judgment against Iran as an epitome of the phrase “Pyrrhic victory” [76 F. Supp. 2d, Memorandum Opinion, p. 27].Flatow led to a further amendment of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act with the purpose of allowing United States victims of terrorism to attach and execute judgments against a foreign State’s diplomatic or consular properties. The amendment, however, included a provision allowing the United States President to suspend its application [The amendment is contained in paragraph 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act of 1999, as contained in the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act of 1999, Pub. L. No. 105-277, 112 Stat. 2681 (1998). See 93 AJIL at p. 185]. On 21 October 1998 President Clinton exercised this power, reasoning as follows:“If this section [of the Act] were to result in attachment and execution against foreign embassy properties, it would encroach on my authority under the Constitution to ‘receive Ambassadors and other public Ministers’. Moreover, if applied to foreign diplomatic or consular property, section 177 would place the United States in breach of its international treaty obligations. It would put at risk the protection we enjoy at every embassy and consulate throughout the world by eroding the principle that diplomatic property must be protected regardless of bilateral relations. Absent my authority to waive section 177’s attachment provision, it would also effectively eliminate use of blocked assets of terrorist States in the national security interests of the United States, including denying an important source of leverage. In addition, section 177 could seriously affect our ability to enter into global claims settlements that are fair to all United States claimants and could result in United States taxpayer liability in the event of a contrary claims tribunal judgment. To the extent possible, I shall construe section 177 in a manner consistent with my constitutional authority and with United States international legal obligations, and for the above reasons, I have exercised the waiver authority in the national security interest of the United States.” [Statement on Signing the Omnibus Consolidated and Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act, 1999, 34 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2108, 2133 (October 23, 1998), as quoted in 93 AJIL, pp. 185-86]A holding that immunity is incompatible with Article 6 of the Convention because of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture would have made it difficult to take into account any considerations of this kind. In other words, in order not to contradict itself the Court would have been forced to hold that the prohibition of torture must also prevail over immunity of a foreign State’s public property, such as bank accounts intended for public purposes, real estate used for a foreign State’s cultural institutes and other establishments abroad (including even, it would appear, embassy buildings), etc., since it has not been suggested that immunity of such public property from execution belongs to the corps of jus cogens. Although giving absolute priority to the prohibition of torture may at first sight seem very “progressive”, a more careful consideration tends to confirm that such a step would also run the risk of proving a sort of “Pyrrhic victory”. International cooperation, including cooperation with a view to eradicating the vice of torture, presupposes the continuing existence of certain elements of a basic framework for the conduct of international relations. Principles concerning State immunity belong to that regulatory framework, and I believe it is more conducive to orderly international cooperation to leave this framework intact than to follow another course.In my view this case leaves us with at least two important lessons. First, although consequences should not alone determine the interpretation of a given rule, one should never totally lose sight of the consequences of a particular interpretation one is about to adopt. Secondly, when having to touch upon central questions of general international law, this Court should be very cautious before taking upon itself the role of a forerunner [That previous international practice does not support the conclusion that the erga omnes or jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture has the consequence of obliging States to make their civil courts available for the victims of such violations is convincingly demonstrated by a study conducted by a group of distinguished international lawyers under the auspices of the British Branch of the International Law Association – see [2001] E.H.R.L.R. 129, particularly pp. 138 and 151]. I started this opinion by quoting Lord Justice Stuart-Smith. I end it by quoting another eminent jurist, Sir Robert Jennings, who some years ago expressed concern about “the tendency of particular tribunals to regard themselves as different, as separate little empires which must as far as possible be augmented” [Sir Robert Jennings, “The Proliferation of Adjudicatory Bodies: Dangers and Possible Answers” in Implications of the Proliferation of International Adjudicatory Bodies for Dispute Resolution, Asil Bulletin: Educational Resources on International Law, Number 9, November 1995, 2 at p. 6]. I believe that in this case the Court has avoided the kind of development of which Sir Robert warned.likely to lead to situations incompatible with the principle of the rule of law which the Contracting States undertook to respect when they ratified the Convention ... Execution of a judgment given by any court must therefore be regarded as an integral part of the ‘trial’ for the purposes of Article 6 ...” (ibid.).The acceptance of the applicant’s argument concerning access to a court would thus have required a possibility of having judgments – probably often default judgments – delivered in torture cases executed against respondent States.

See also 93 American Journal of International Law (AJIL)181 (1999)], this narrowly limited statutory amendment did not affect the immunity of a foreign State’s public property from attachment and execution, causing the District Court Judge Royce C.

Unlike the majority, we consider that the applicant was unduly deprived of his right of access to English courts to entertain the merits of his claim against the State of Kuwait although that claim was linked to serious allegations of torture. To us the main reasoning of the majority – that the standards applicable in civil cases differ from those applying in criminal matters when a conflict arises between the peremptory norm of international law on the prohibition of torture and the rules on State immunity – raises fundamental questions, and we disagree for the following reasons.1. The Court’s majority unequivocally accept that the rule on the prohibition of torture had achieved at the material time, namely at the time when civil proceedings were instituted by the applicant before the English courts, the status of a peremptory rule of international law (jus cogens). They refer to a number of authorities which demonstrate that the prohibition of torture has gradually crystallised as a jus cogens rule. To this conclusion we readily subscribe and in further support of this we refer to the Statutes of the ad hoc Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, and to the Statute of the International Criminal Court, which also gives a definition of the crime [See Article 7 § 2 (e) of the Statute of the International Criminal Court]. State practice corroborates this conclusion [See, inter alia, the judgment of the Swiss Tribunal Fédéral in the case of Sener c. Ministère public de la Confédération et Département fédéral de justice et police where, as early as 1983, the tribunal accepted that the rule of the prohibition of torture of the European Convention on Human Rights is a rule of jus cogens: “… il s’agit là, selon le Tribunal Fédéral , .. de règles contraignantes [recte : impératives] du droit des gens, règles dont il convient de tenir compte dans l’examen d’une demande d’extradition, que la Suisse soit ou non liée avec l’Etat requérant par la convention européenne d’extradition, la convention européenne des Droits de l’Homme ou un traité bilatéral….” (ATF vol. 109 Ib, p. 72)].By accepting that the rule on prohibition of torture is a rule of jus cogens, the majority recognise that it is hierarchically higher than any other rule of international law, be it general or particular, customary or conventional, with the exception, of course, of other jus cogens norms. For the basic characteristic of a jus cogens rule is that, as a source of law in theJOINT DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGES ROZAKIS AND CAFLISCH JOINED BY JUDGES WILDHABER, COSTA, CABRAL BARRETO AND VAJIĆWe regret that we are unable to concur with the Court’s majority in finding that, in the present case, there has not been a violation of Article 6 of the Convention in so far as the right of access to a court is concerned.

For the basic characteristic of a jus cogens rule is that, as a source of law in thenow vertical international legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same status. In the event of a conflict between a jus cogens rule and any other rule of international law, the former prevails. The consequence of such prevalence is that the conflicting rule is null and void, or, in any event, does not produce legal effects which are in contradiction with the content of the peremptory rule.2. The Court’s majority do not seem, on the other hand, to deny that the rules on State immunity; customary or conventional, do not belong to the category of jus cogens; and rightly so, because it is clear that the rules of State immunity, deriving from both customary and conventional international law, have never been considered by the international community as rules with a hierarchically higher status. It is common knowledge that, in many instances, States have, through their own initiative, waived their rights of immunity; that in many instances they have contracted out of them, or have renounced them. These instances clearly demonstrate that the rules on State immunity do not enjoy a higher status, since jus cogens rules, protecting as they do the “ordre public”, that is the basic values of the international community, cannot be subject to unilateral or contractual forms of derogation from their imperative contents.3. The acceptance therefore of the jus cogens nature of the prohibition of torture entails that a State allegedly violating it cannot invoke hierarchically lower rules (in this case, those on State immunity) to avoid the consequences of the illegality of its actions. In the circumstances of this case, Kuwait cannot validly hide behind the rules on State immunity to avoid proceedings for a serious claim of torture made before a foreign jurisdiction; and the courts of that jurisdiction (the United Kingdom) cannot accept a plea of immunity, or invoke it ex officio, to refuse an applicant adjudication of a torture case. Due to the interplay of the jus cogens rule on prohibition of torture and the rules on State immunity, the procedural bar of State immunity is automatically lifted, because those rules, as they conflict with a hierarchically higher rule, do not produce any legal effect. In the same vein, national law which is designed to give domestic effect to the international rules on State immunity cannot be invoked as creating a jurisdictional bar, but must be interpreted in accordance with and in the light of the imperative precepts of jus cogens.4. The majority, while accepting that the rule on the prohibition of torture is a jus cogens norm, refuse to draw the consequences of such acceptance. They contend that a distinction must be made between criminal proceedings, where apparently they accept that a jus cogens rule has the overriding force to deprive the rules of sovereign immunity from their legal effects, and civil proceedings, where, in the absence of authority, they consider that the same conclusion cannot be drawn. Their position is well summarised in paragraph 66 of the judgment, where they assert that they do not find it established that “there is yet acceptance in international law of the proposition that States are not entitled to immunity in respect of civil claims for damages for alleged torture committed outside the forum State”. Hence, “[t]he 1978 Act, which grants immunity to States in respect of personal injury claims not inconsistent with those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity”.In our opinion, the distinction made by the majority and their conclusions are defective on two grounds.Firstly, the English courts, when dealing with the applicant’s claim, never resorted to the distinction made by the majority. They never invoked any difference between criminal charges or civil claims, between criminal and civil proceedings, in so far as the legal force of the rules on State immunity or the applicability of the 1978 Act was concerned. The basic position of the Court of Appeal – the last court which dealt with the matter in its essence – is expressed by the observations of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith who simply denied that the prohibition of torture was a jus cogens rule. In reading the Lord Justice’s observations, one even forms the impression that if the Court of Appeal had been convinced that the rule of prohibition of torture was a norm of jus cogens, they could grudgingly have admitted that the procedural bar of State immunity did not apply in the circumstances of the case.Secondly, the distinction made by the majority between civil and criminal proceedings, concerning the effect of the rule of the prohibition of torture, is not consonant with the very essence of the operation of the jus cogens rules. It is not the nature of the proceedings which determines the effects that a jus cogens rule has upon another rule of international law, but the character of the rule as a peremptory norm and its interaction with a hierarchically lower rule. The prohibition of torture, being a rule of jus cogens, acts in the international sphere and deprives the rule of sovereign immunity of all its legal effects in that sphere. The criminal or civil nature of the domestic proceedings is immaterial. The jurisdictional bar is lifted by the very interaction of the international rules involved, and the national judge cannot admit a plea of immunity raised by the defendant State as an element preventing him from entering into the merits of the case and from dealing with the claim of the applicant for the alleged damages inflicted upon him.Under these circumstances we believe that the English courts have erred in considering that they had no jurisdiction to entertain the applicant’s claim because of the procedural bar of State immunity and the consequent application of the 1978 Act. Accordingly, the applicant was deprived of his right to have access to the English court to entertain his claim of damages for the alleged torture suffered by him in Kuwait, and Article 6 § 1, has, in our view, been violated.now vertical international legal system, it overrides any other rule which does not have the same status. In the event of a conflict between a jus cogens rule and any other rule of international law, the former prevails. The consequence of such prevalence is that the conflicting rule is null and void, or, in any event, does not produce legal effects which are in contradiction with the content of the peremptory rule.2. The Court’s majority do not seem, on the other hand, to deny that the rules on State immunity; customary or conventional, do not belong to the category of jus cogens; and rightly so, because it is clear that the rules of State immunity, deriving from both customary and conventional international law, have never been considered by the international community as rules with a hierarchically higher status.

Due to the interplay of the jus cogens rule on prohibition of torture and the rules on State immunity, the procedural bar of State immunity is automatically lifted, because those rules, as they conflict with a hierarchically higher rule, do not produce any legal effect. In the same vein, national law which is designed to give domestic effect to the international rules on State immunity cannot be invoked as creating a jurisdictional bar, but must be interpreted in accordance with and in the light of the imperative precepts of jus cogens.4. The majority, while accepting that the rule on the prohibition of torture is a jus cogens norm, refuse to draw the consequences of such acceptance. They contend that a distinction must be made between criminal proceedings, where apparently they accept that a jus cogens rule has the overriding force to deprive the rules of sovereign immunity from their legal effects, and civil proceedings, where, in the absence of authority, they consider that the same conclusion cannot be drawn. Their position is well summarised in paragraph 66 of the judgment, where they assert that they do not find it established that “there is yet acceptance in international law of the proposition that States are not entitled to immunity in respect of civil claims for damages for alleged torture committed outside the forum State”. Hence, “[t]he 1978 Act, which grants immunity to States in respect of personal injury claims not inconsistent with those limitations generally accepted by the community of nations as part of the doctrine of State immunity”.In our opinion, the distinction made by the majority and their conclusions are defective on two grounds.Firstly, the English courts, when dealing with the applicant’s claim, never resorted to the distinction made by the majority. They never invoked any difference between criminal charges or civil claims, between criminal and civil proceedings, in so far as the legal force of the rules on State immunity or the applicability of the 1978 Act was concerned. The basic position of the Court of Appeal – the last court which dealt with the matter in its essence – is expressed by the observations of Lord Justice Stuart-Smith who simply denied that the prohibition of torture was a jus cogens rule. In reading the Lord Justice’s observations, one even forms the impression that if the Court of Appeal had been convinced that the rule of prohibition of torture was a norm of jus cogens, they could grudgingly have admitted that the procedural bar of State immunity did not apply in the circumstances of the case.Secondly, the distinction made by the majority between civil and criminal proceedings, concerning the effect of the rule of the prohibition of torture, is not consonant with the very essence of the operation of the jus cogens rules. It is not the nature of the proceedings which determines the effects that a jus cogens rule has upon another rule of international law, but the character of the rule as a peremptory norm and its interaction with a hierarchically lower rule. The prohibition of torture, being a rule of jus cogens, acts in the international sphere and deprives the rule of sovereign immunity of all its legal effects in that sphere. The criminal or civil nature of the domestic proceedings is immaterial. The jurisdictional bar is lifted by the very interaction of the international rules involved, and the national judge cannot admit a plea of immunity raised by the defendant State as an element preventing him from entering into the merits of the case and from dealing with the claim of the applicant for the alleged damages inflicted upon him.Under these circumstances we believe that the English courts have erred in considering that they had no jurisdiction to entertain the applicant’s claim because of the procedural bar of State immunity and the consequent application of the 1978 Act. Accordingly, the applicant was deprived of his right to have access to the English court to entertain his claim of damages for the alleged torture suffered by him in Kuwait, and Article 6 § 1, has, in our view, been violated.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE FERRARI BRAVO(Translation)What a pity! The Court, whose task in this case was to rule whether there had been a violation of Article 6 § 1, had a golden opportunity to issue a clear and forceful condemnation of all acts of torture. To do so, it need only have upheld the thrust of the House of Lords’ judgment in Regina v. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary and Others, ex parte Pinochet Ugarte (No. 3) (judgment of 24 March 1999 [2000] Appeal Cases 147), to the effect that the prohibition of torture is now jus cogens, so that torture is a crime under international law. It follows that every State has a duty to contribute to the punishment of torture and cannot hide behind formalist arguments to avoid having to give judgment.I say to “contribute” to punishment, and not, obviously, to punish, since it was clear that the acts of torture had not taken place in the United Kingdom but elsewhere, in a State over which the Court did not have jurisdiction.But it is precisely one of those old formalist arguments which the Court endorsed when it said (in paragraph 61 of the judgment) that it was unable to discern any rules of international law requiring it not to apply the rule of immunity from civil suit where acts of torture were alleged. And the Court went further, notwithstanding its analysis of the cases mentioned in paragraphs 62 to 65, concluding sadly in paragraph 66 that the contrary rule was not yet accepted. Quousque tandem ...!There will be other such cases, but the Court has unfortunately missed a very good opportunity to deliver a courageous judgment.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE FERRARI BRAVO(Translation)What a pity!

Quousque tandem ...!There will be other such cases, but the Court has unfortunately missed a very good opportunity to deliver a courageous judgment.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE LOUCAIDESI agree with the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Rozakis and Caflisch. Indeed, once it is accepted that the prohibition of torture is a jus cogens rule of international law prevailing over State immunity rules, no such immunity can be invoked in respect of any judicial proceedings whose object is the attribution of legal responsibility to any person for any act of torture. I cannot see why there should be a distinction between criminal and civil proceedings in this respect, as contended by the majority. In view of the absolute nature of the prohibition of torture it would be a travesty of law to allow exceptions in respect of civil liability by permitting the concept of State immunity to be relied on successfully against a claim for compensation by any victim of torture. The rationale behind the principle of international law that those responsible for atrocious acts of torture must be accountable is not based solely on the objectives of criminal law. It is equally valid in relation to any legal liability whatsoever.However, I would prefer to adopt as my main reasoning for finding a violation of Article 6 in this case the same approach that I adopt in McElhinney v. Ireland ([GC], no. 31253/96, ECHR 2001-XI) and Fogarty v. the United Kingdom ([GC], no. 37112/97, ECHR 2001-XI), which can be summed up as follows. Any form of blanket immunity, whether based on international law or national law, which is applied by a court in order to block completely the judicial determination of a civil right without balancing the competing interests, namely those connected with the particular immunity and those relating to the nature of the specific claim which is the subject matter of the relevant proceedings, is a disproportionate limitation on Article 6 § 1 of the Convention and for that reason it amounts to a violation of that Article. The courts should be in a position to weigh the competing interests in favour of upholding an immunity or allowing a judicial determination of a civil right, after looking into the subject matter of the proceedings.It is true that in the present case the absurd and unjust results of applying a blanket immunity without regard to any considerations connected with the specific proceedings are more evident because the immunity prevented accountability for a grave violation of an international peremptory norm, namely the prohibition of torture. However, this does not mean that the relevant immunities can only be found to be incompatible with Article 6 § 1 in a case like the present one. In my opinion, they are incompatible with Article 6 § 1 in all those cases where their application is automatic without a balancing of the competing interests as explained above.DISSENTING OPINION OF JUDGE LOUCAIDESI agree with the joint dissenting opinion of Judges Rozakis and Caflisch.

In the United Nations Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, adopted on 10 December 1984 (“the UN Convention”), torture is defined as:“For the purposes of this Convention, the term ‘torture’ means any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. It does not include pain or suffering arising only from, inherent in or incidental to lawful sanctions.”The UN Convention requires by Article 2 that each State Party is to take effective legislative, administrative, judicial or other measures to prevent torture in any territory under its jurisdiction, and by Article 4 that all acts of torture be made offences under each State’s criminal law.30. In its judgment in Prosecutor v. Furundzija (10 December 1998, case no. IT-95-17/I-T, (1999) 38 International Legal Materials 317), the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia observed as follows:“144. It should be noted that the prohibition of torture laid down in human rights treaties enshrines an absolute right, which can never be derogated from, not even in time of emergency ... This is linked to the fact, discussed below, that the prohibition on torture is a peremptory norm or jus cogens. ... This prohibition is so extensive that States are even barred by international law from expelling, returning or extraditing a person to another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be in danger of being subjected to torture.145. These treaty provisions impose upon States the obligation to prohibit and punish torture, as well as to refrain from engaging in torture through their officials. In international human rights law, which deals with State responsibility rather than individual criminal responsibility, torture is prohibited as a criminal offence to be punished under national law;')]"
